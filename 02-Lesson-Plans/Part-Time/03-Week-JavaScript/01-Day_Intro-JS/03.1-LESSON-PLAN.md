# 03.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to JavaScript

## Overview

This class introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, primitive types, comparison operators, and conditional statements. Students will also gain experience writing console logs and using the developer console in Google Chrome.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog` through `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements`.

* Take a few minutes before class to get familiar with the activities of the day and anticipate questions a student new to JavaScript might ask.

* There is a lot of information in today's lesson that might be new for many students. If you find that the students are feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to point out that these are the building blocks of JavaScript and each activity builds on one another. They can look back at previous activities for guidance or reach out during office hours for help.

* At the beginning of today's class, the students will learn how to link an external JavaScript file and use the developer console in Google Chrome. Please make sure to remind yourself of the various ways to open [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on both Mac and Windows so you can help students navigate the process on their own computers. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify and declare variables containing primitive data types. 

* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators. 

* Write conditional statements using `if...else`.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/125APA1-Q3Tu6Sjevvriy2BQy7y7LCrEqxUlovWNGBt0/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **JavaScript** 
  
    * This unit is all about introducing ourselves to using JavaScript to apply logic and make applications feel more dynamic.

  * **What do we use HTML and CSS for?**

    * We use HTML to create and organize content on a page and CSS to apply styles, layout, and even animation to that content.

  * **What are some examples of how users interact with a web page?**

    * We use HTML to create and organize content on a page and CSS to apply styles, layout, and even animation to that content.

  * **Can we achieve these types of interactions using only HTML and CSS?**

    * We interact with web pages in many ways on a daily basis. Typically the web page will respond or react to these interactions, making the page feel more dynamic and alive.

    * These interactions include:
      
      * Submitting an HTML form to comment on an article
      
      * Playing audio or video at the press of a button on the page
      
      * Using the device‚Äôs camera or microphone to enable a conversation
      
      * And so much more!

  * **Can we achieve these types of interactions using only HTML and CSS?**

    * While there are some great features built into HTML and CSS that give users a sense of interaction or functionality on a site, they cannot handle the complex tasks that occur in response to these interactions. 

    * Because of this, web developers use another programming language specifically designed for these tasks.

  * **So what is this language that works with HTML and CSS?**

    * JavaScript is a programming language originally created to be run in the browser with the intention of enhancing a web page‚Äôs capabilities. Today, nearly every page we visit on the internet is heavily dependent on JavaScript to work.

    * While HTML and CSS handle content and design, JavaScript is what we use to handle the overall functionality of the application to make it feel more alive and dynamic. 

  * **In what ways do we use JavaScript?**

    * Front-end developers use JavaScript primarily to dynamically affect a web page to enhance the user‚Äôs experience. No other programming language can run in the browser, so JavaScript is a must-have skill for web developers  

    * Some examples of how JavaScript is used:

      * Showing a user personal data only after they log into the application

      * Fetching weather data to display and update on the page

      * Inform a user they are missing information when filling out a form
      
      * Remembering a user‚Äôs preference between light and dark mode themes.

  * **How can we learn to use JavaScript?**

    * Unlike some other programming languages, JavaScript doesn‚Äôt force developers to write code in a specific way. This can make JavaScript feel a bit complicated at first, but incredibly fun and creative as we get to use it more and more. 

    * Try some of the following techniques to learn JavaScript:

      * Read the docs and practice with the provided examples.

      * Reverse-engineer finished code to see how it was created.

      * Build something from scratch.
      
      * Debug a broken app using Chrome DevTools.

      * And most importantly, ask questions!

* Inform the students that during today's class, they will take the first steps to build interactive websites with JavaScript. 

* Stress that JavaScript builds on skills they have already learned. HTML provides the structure for the webpage. CSS enhances HTML by providing styling, formatting, and improving presentation. JavaScript is what makes webpages dynamic.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/index.html` in your browser and follow the prompts to enter `R, P, or S` to show the students the functionality of the game.

  * Explain that this is the game Rock, Paper, Scissors, where a player can play against a computer.

  * Remind students of what this game is, how to play it, and what conditions are met to win, lose, or tie. 

  * üîë Point out how none of this is happening through the HTML content, but rather a JavaScript file that's attached to `index.html`.

  * üîë Explain that JavaScript code is handling the following:

    * The different browser dialog boxes that appear with different messages and prompts.

    * Reading the user-provided input from the prompt and comparing it to a randomly picked computer choice.

    * Determining who wins the round based on conditions that we (the developer) must define.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning how to add interactivity and logic to JavaScript applications.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We've learned HTML and CSS to create and present content; now we'll make it interactive and dynamic.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã JavaScript is used to power most modern web applications and is crucial for us to know and use as web developers. This project will help us learn how to use JavaScript to apply logic, rules, and interactivity to applications without having the added distraction of HTML and CSS, which we already know a bit.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Script and Console.Log (5 min)

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë In this HTML file, HTML and CSS are working together to provide style and structure to the page, as you can see in the following example:

    ```html
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Open the Console to See the Magic ‚ú®! </h1>
    ```
    
  * üîë There is also something new: `<script>` tags for JavaScript.

  * üîë We use inline `<script>` tags to write scripts directly in an HTML file, as shown in the following example:

    ```html
    <script>
    console.log("This is the log for the üî•INLINEüî• JavasScript");
    </script> 
    ```

  * üîë We add an src attribute to the opening `<script>` tag to allow us to link to an external JavaScript file, as follows:

    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```

  * üîë We write `<script>` tags above the closing `</body>` tag to ensure that the HTML and CSS load first, as follows:
  
    ```html
    <body>
      <h1 style="text-align:center;">Open the Console to See the Magic ‚ú®! </h1>
      <script>
      console.log("This is the log for the üî•INLINEüî• JavasSript");
      </script>
      <script src="script.js"></script>
    </body>    
    ```

  * We use the `console.log` method to "log" or display messages or data to the console. We place the message inside a `string` between the parentheses of the function call, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log("This is the log for the üî•INLINEüî• JavasScript");
    ```

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\script.js` in your IDE and note the following: 

  *  JavaScript looks and performs the same whether it is written inline or in an external file. As shown in the following snippet, this will log the message "This is the log for the üî•EXTERNALüî•JavaScript":

      ```js
      console.log("This is the log for the üî•EXTERNALüî•JavaScript");
      ```

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\index.html` in the browser and demonstrate how to navigate to the console in Chrome DevTools. 

* Point out that both the console log from the inline JavaScript and external file appear as messages in the console.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do you link an HTML file to an external JavaScript file?
  
  *  üôã Use `<script>` tags and set the `src` attribute to the path of the external JavaScript file.
  
  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does the console log function do?
 
  *  üôã It logs a message to the console. 

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Script-ConsoleLog\README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Script and Console.Log (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Script-ConsoleLog\README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.
 
```md
# üìñ Link External JavaScript File to Existing HTML File

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

As a developer, I want to link an external JavaScript file to an existing `index.html` file to add JavaScript functionality to my static web page. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I open the `index.html`, navigate to the console, and see the message contained in the `script.js` file logged to the console. 

## Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs on the script element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)

[Google documentation on opening Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open)

## üí° Hint

It is best practice to add a link to an external JavaScript file above what closing HTML tag? 

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Comments are a key part of a developer's toolbox. Why do you think it is so important to include comments in your code? How do you write single-line and multi-line comments in Javascript?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Script and Console.Log (10 min)

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with linking an external JavaScript file to your HTML? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `<script>` tags 

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `console.log()` 

* Open`01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We use inline `<script>` tags to add JavaScript directly in the HTML file, as shown in the following example:

    ```html
    <script>
    console.log("This is inline JavaScript");
    </script>
    ```
  
  * üîë When we add an `src` attribute to a `<script>` tag, it links to an external JavaScript file, as shown in the following example:
  
    ```html
    <script src="script.js"></script>
    ```

  * üîë A console log is a JavaScript function. We write the message to the console between the parentheses`()`, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log("This is inline JavaScript");
    ```

* Open`01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console. Show the students that the message written between the `()`is the same as what appears in the console.
  
* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are two ways that the `<script>` tag is used to add JavaScript to HTML files?

  * üôã The `<script>` tag can be used to create inline JavaScript by writing code in between the opening and closing tags. The`<script>`tag, when given an src attribute that equals the path to an external JavaScript file, links the HTML file to the external JavaScript page.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the script element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Hello Variable (5 min) 

* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use the `var` keyword to declare a variable. After the `var`, the variable is given a unique name, or identifier, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var studentName;
    ```

  * üîë When we declare a variable, it only gives it a name. To assign a value, we use the assignment operator `=` followed by the value we want the variable to hold, as shown in the following example: 

    ```js
    var studentName = "Abdul";
    var studentAge = 32;
    ```

  * üîë We also use the `=` assignment operator to reassign a new value to a variable. To reassign a value, we use the variable's name followed by `=` and the new value we want the variable to hold. Because the variable has already been declared, there is no need to use `var` again, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    studentName = "Tonya";
    studentAge = 52;
    ``` 

  * üîë Using the variable name is also useful in code when we want to access the value held in the variable to do something with it, like log it to the console. 

  * üîë In the previous activity, we put a value directly into the `()` in a console log function to log a message. When the value was entered directly, that value appeared as the message in the console, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    console.log("My name is ");
    ```

  * üîë When we want to access a value stored in a variable, we don't directly enter the value. We use the variable name&mdash;without quotes&mdash;to access the value stored in the variable instead. Because the value of `studentName` is currently `Tonya`, the following console log will log `Tonya`:

    ```js
    console.log(studentName);
    ```
 
  * üîë Sometimes, we want to use a variable as part of a longer message logged to the console. To do that, we use the concatenation operator (`+`). In the following example, `"My name is "` is concatenated, or combined, with the value stored in the variable `studentName` to form the longer message `"My name is Tonya"`:

    ```js
    console.log("My name is " + studentName);
    ```
  
* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When we combine the value `"My name is "` and the value stored in the `studentName` variable with a `+`, it logs a single message `"My name is Tonya"`. Using the concatenation operator to combine variable values into more complex messages will be useful in creating your introductions. 
  
* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What keyword is used to declare a variable? 

  * üôã The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What operator is used to assign a value to a declared variable?  

  * üôã The `=` assignment operator is used to assign and reassign a value to a variable that has already been declared. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do you access the value assigned to a variable?  

  * üôã Use the variable's name. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Hello Variable (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# üèóÔ∏è Log Introduction Messages to Console Using Values Stored in Variables 

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a class member, I want to input a name, number of pets, and a fun fact about myself and log an introduction to the console. Then, by only reassigning the variables, I want to log a message to introduce my partner.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I store a name in a variable called `name` and this line is logged to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

* It is done when I store a number in a variable called `pets` and this line is logged to the console:  "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS` pet(s)."

* It is done when I store a fun fact in a variable called `funFact` and this line is logged to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT`."

* It is done when I reassign the values of `name`, `pets`, and `funFact` with my new partner's information the logs in the console reflect the new values.

## üí° Hints

How can we combine values using the concatenation operator (`+`) to log a single message to the console?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What happens when you concatenate two variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Hello Variable (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with JavaScript variables? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Variable declaration

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Value assignment

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Accessing stored values

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Value reassignment

* Open `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We declare variables using `var` and assigned a value using `=`. The variable `name` is declared using `var` and assigned the value `"Sakura"`, as follows:

    ```js
    var name = "Sakura";
    ```

  * üîë The variable's values are accessed using the variables' names. Because we have assigned the variables the values `"Sakura"`, `3` , `"I like pineapple on my pizza."`, those are the values that are used in the following console logs: 

    ```js
    console.log("My name is " + name + ".");
    console.log("I have " + pets + " pet(s).");
    console.log("Fun fact: " + funFact);
    ```

  * üîë We reassign a variable's values using `=`. As shown in the following example, the `var` keyword is not used during reassignment because the variable has already been declared:

    ```js
    name = "Mateo";
    pets = 5;
    funFact = "I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."
    ```

  * After the variables are reassigned, when we use variable names it will access the new values `"Mateo"`, `5`, `"I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."`. The console logs will use the new values, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log("My name is " + name + ".");
    console.log("I have " + pets + " pet(s).");
    console.log("Fun fact: " + funFact);
    ```

* Open`01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console. 

    * Note that the logs created by using `+` appear as a single message in the console. 

    * In the first introduction, the console logs use the values stored in variables as originally assigned (`"Sakura"`, `3` , `"I like pineapple on my pizza."`). 

    * Then, point out that the second introduction, the console logs uses the reassigned values (`"Mateo"`, `5`, `"I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."`). 
    
    * Point out that the only thing different in the two introductions are the values accessed by variables. That is because the code for the console logs has not changed. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we reassign a new value to a variable?  

    * üôã We can reassign a variable's value by using the assignment operator `=`. We do not need to use `var` because the variable is already declared.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How do you think the ability to reassign values to a variable might be useful in your code? 

    * üôã Reassigning values to variables makes code more flexible and reusable. In the activity we just completed, we were able to log new messages to the console simply by reassigning the values stored in the variables. 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on variables and storing the information you need](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Primitive Types (5 min) 

  *  In the previous activity, we learned to store values in variables. In this activity, we will take a deeper dive into the types of values that are stored in variables, namely the primitive types: `undefined`, `string`, `number` and `boolean`.

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/script.js` in your IDE and point out the following: 

  * üîë A variable that has been declared using `var` but has not yet been assigned a value has the type of undefined. Undefined, as shown in the following snippet, simply means no value has been assigned yet:

    ```js
    var myUndefined;
    ```

  * üîë Strings should already look familiar because we have already been using them in code. Values with the type of string are a series of characters. They are commonly words, but can also include other characters. Strings are always surrounded by quotes, like in the following example:

    ```js
    var myStringWelcome = "Hello World"; 
    var myStringPassword = "865Password!2020";
    ```

  * üîë Numbers should look familiar too! In JavaScript, a number can be either an integer (whole number) or a decimal, as follows:

    ```js
    var myNumberInt = 100;
    var myNumberDecimal = 100.100;
    ```

  * üîë Booleans are unique because they hold only two values (`true` or `false`), as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var isMyBooleanTrue = true;
    var isMyBooleanFalse = false;
    ```

  * üîë Sometimes, we want to check what type of value is stored in a variable. To evaluate type, use the `typeof` operator followed by the variable name or value, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof myUndefined);

    console.log(typeof myNumber); 

    console.log(typeof true);

    console.log(typeof "Howdy");
    ```

  * üîë When a variable is reassigned, its type can change too. For example, `myVariable` originally has the value of `33` and type of `number`. Then, when we use `=` to reassign it, as shown in the following example, it has the value of `false` and the type of `boolean`:

    ```js
    var myVariable = 33;
    console.log(typeof myVariable);

    myVariable = false;
    console.log(typeof myVariable); 
    ```

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console. Point out the following:

  * The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type, including `undefined`, `number`, `boolean`, and `string`.

  * When we reassign a variable, the type can change as well. In this case, `myVariable` was first assigned with a number with a value of `33`. As a result, we can see it logged `number`. Then, when `myVariable` was reassigned as a boolean with a value of `false`, `boolean` is logged, indicating the type has changed. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What primitive type has only two values? 

  * üôã A Boolean has only two values: `true` or `false`. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the only primitive type that must be surrounded by quotes?

  * üôã Strings.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What primitive type would we use if we wanted to store a decimal or an integer?

  * üôã Numbers.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è If we reassign a variable a new value, does the type have to stay the same?

  * üôã No! JavaScript is loosely typed. This means that when we declare a variable we don't have to specify a type that the variable will hold. It also means that when a variable is reassigned the type can change too. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/README.md`.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs on typeof](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof)

[MDN Web Docs on JavaScript data types and data structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* There are two more primitive value types in JavaScript. What is BigInt and Symbol?  

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Primitive Values (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with Primitive Types? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Numbers

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Strings

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Booleans

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Typeof operator

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Type reassignment

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Undefined

* Open `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë The variable `one` has the whole number value of `64` and the type of `number`, as follows:

    ```js
    var one = 64;
    ```

  * üîë Using `typeof` operator, `number` is logged, as follows:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof one);
    ```

  * üîë The variable `two` has the value of `"656302"`. Because the value is surrounded by quotes, it is a string even if the characters inside the strings are numbers! See the following code for an example:

    ```
    var two = "656302";
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, `string` is logged, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof two);
    ```

  * üîë The variable `three` has a value of `false`. `True` and `false` values are booleans, like in the following example:

    ```js
    var three = false;
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, as follows, `boolean` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof three);
    ```

  * The variable `four` has a decimal value of 64.55. Because both integers and decimals are considered numbers in JavaScript, the type in the following example is `number`:

    ```js
    var four = 64.55;
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, as follows, `number` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof four);
    ```

  * In the following code, the variable `five` has a value of `"Howdy"`, which is a string:

    ```js
    var five = "Howdy!";
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, as follows, `string` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof five);
    ```

  * üîë The variable `six` is declared but has not yet been assigned a value. So the type returns `undefined` in the following example:

    ```js
    var six;
    ```

  * When we use the `typeof` operator, like in the following code, `string` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof six);
    ```

  * üîë When we reassign a value, as follows, it can change both value and type:

    ```js
    four = "Hello!";
    five = false;
    six = 23;
    ```

  * Variable `four` now has a type of `string`. So when we use `typeof`, like in the following example, `string` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof four);
    ```

  * Variable `five` now has a type of `boolean`. So when we use `typeof`, as follows, `boolean` is logged:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof five);
    ```

  * üîë Because variable `six` now has been assigned a value using the `=` assignment operator, it is no longer `undefined`. Instead, when we use `typeof`, as follows, type is `number`:

    ```js
    console.log(typeof four);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are four primitive types of values? 

  * üôã Undefined, strings, booleans and numbers.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we test the type of a value? 

  * üôã Use `typeof` operator.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on JavaScript data types and data structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Logical and Comparison Operators (5 min) 

* Open `07-Ins_Logical-Comparison-Operators/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We can use arithmetic operators to create simple math equations. We set the variable `a` to have a value of `100` and variable `b` to `10` . Both of these are of the data type `number`  When we run `a + b`, as follows, it will return the value, or evaluate to `110`:

    ```js
    var a = 100;
    var b = 10;

    console.log(a + b);
    ```

  * üîë Arithmetic operators include addition(`+`), subtraction(`-`), division(`\`) and multiplication(`*`).

    ```js
    console.log(a + b);
    console.log(a - b);
    console.log(a / b);
    console.log(a * b);
      ```

  * üîë Modulus `%` is an arithmetic operator that allows to return the `remainder` or what is left over after dividing one number by another. When we divide `100` by `10`, the remainder is `0` because `10` divides into `100` evenly. So `a%b` returns `0`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    var a = 100;
    var b = 10;

    console.log(a % b);
    ```

  *  In addition to performing math equations, we can also use comparison operators to determine the equality of difference of values. 

  * üîë We can compare if two values are equal using the equality operator(`==`). The value of `b` and `c` are both `10`. So `b == c`, in the following example, returns `true`:

    ```js
    var b = 10;
    var c = "10";

    console.log(b == c);
    ```

  * üîë We can also test for inequality using the inequality operator(`!=`). Because the value of `b` and `c` are both `10`, `b != c` returns `false` in the following example: 

    ```js
    console.log(b != c);
    ```

  * üîë When we use `==`, it only tests for equality of value. To test strict equality, we use `===`. The value of `b` and `c` are both `10` but one is a `string` and the other is a `number`. Because they are not equal in both value and type, `b === c` returns `false` in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(b === c);
    ```

  * üîë We can also test for inequality of value or type using `!==`. The variables `b` and `c` do not have the same type (one is a `string` and the other is a `number`). So either value or type is inequal, `b !== c ` returns `true` in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(b !== c);
    ```

  * üîë To evaluate greater than or less than, we use the greater than (`>`) or less than (`<`) operators. If `a` is greater than `b`, the first expression returns `true`. If `a` is less than `b`, the second expression returns `true` in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(a > b);
    console.log(a < b);
    ```

  * üîë To evaluate greater than or equal to and less than or equal to, we use `>=` or `<=`. In this case, if `a` is greater than or equal or equal to`b`, the first expression returns `true`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the second expression returns `true` in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(a <= b);
    console.log(a >= b);
    ```

  * It is also possible to determine logic between expressions using logical operators and(`&&`), or(`||`), and not(`!`).

  * üîë We use the logical operator `&&` to check if both expressions evaluate to `true`. If both expressions evaluate to `true`, then `true` is returned. Otherwise, `false` is returned. See the following code snippet for an example:

    ```js
    console.log(expression1 && expression2);
    ``` 

  * üîë We use the logical operator `!!` to check if one expression OR the other evaluates to true. If one expression evaluates to `true`, then `true` is returned. Otherwise, `false` is returned. See the following code snippet for an example:

    ```js
    console.log(expression1 || expression2);
    ```

  * üîë The logical operator `!` adds `not` to an expression, negating it. If the expression evaluates to `true`, then we can add `!` to it, making it `not true` or `false` (or vice-versa), as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(expression2);

    console.log(!expression2);
    ```
  
* Open `07-Ins_Logical-Comparison-Operators/index.html` in your browser and open the console to explain the following:

  * Arithmetic operators can be used with numbers to create math equations. When we log these equations, they return a single number as seen in the first five logs. 

  * Expressions using logical and comparison operators evaluate to `true` or `false`. As a result, we can see the remainder of the logs are `true` or `false`.

  * As demonstrated in the final two console logs, when we use the `!` operator, it negates the expression, turning `true` to `false`.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can arithmetic operators do? 

  * üôã An arithmetic operator can perform simple math problems like adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing or even finding the remainder. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What type of operators are used to evaluate equality and difference? 

  * üôã Comparison operators.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What operators determine logic between expressions?  

  * üôã Logical operators.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does an expression using a logical or comparison operator evaluate to? 

  * üôã True or false.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Logical-Comparison-Operators/README>md`.

### 13. Student Do: Logical and Comparison Operators (15 min)

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 14. Instructor Review: Logical and Comparison Operators (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `Logical and Comparison Operators`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Arithmetic operators

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Comparison operators

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Logical operators

* Open `09-Stu-Logical-Comparison-Operators/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * Variables `d` and `e` use arithmetic operators to perform simple math. Because `c` has a value of `100` and `b` has a value of `50`, when we calcuate the remainder of `100` divided by `50` it is `0`. So the value of `d` is `0`. Likewise, the value of `e` is `100` divided by `2` or `50`. Both variables `d` and `e` have the type of `number` in the following example:

    ```js
    var b = 50;
    var c = 100;
    var d = c % b;
    var e = c / 2;
    ```

  * Both `b` and `e` have the value of `50` and the type of `number`. So `expression1` evaluates to `true` in the following example:

    ```js
    var expression1 = (b === e);
    ```

  * The variable `e` has a value of `50` and variable `d` has a value of `0`. Because `50` is not less than `0`, `expression2` evaluates to `false` in the following example:

    ```js
    var expression2 = (e < d);
    ```

  * Because `a` holds the value `50` with the type of `string` and `b` holds the value `50` with the type of `number`, `===` returns `false` because while the values are equal, the type is not. However, when we use `==` it returns `true` because `==` evaluates only value (not type!) in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(a == b);
    ```

  * The variables `b` and `e` both hold the value `50` and the type `number`. Because they are equal in value and type, when we use `===`, it returns `true`, like in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(b === e);
    ```

  * Because `c` is greater than `b`, when we use the comparison operator `>`, it returns true, like in the following example:

    ```js
    console.log(c > b);
    ```

  * Because `d` evaluates to `0`, it is less than `1`. So when we use comparison operator `<`, as follows, it returns `true`:

    ```js
    console.log(d < 1);
    ```

  * Because the `||` operator requires only one expression or the other to evaluate to `true`, when we use `||` in the following example, it returns `true`:

    ```js
    console.log(expression1 || expression2);
    ```
  
  * Alternately, it is possible to negate `expression2` so that it returns `true`. Because both expressions now evaluate to true when we use the `!` operator, the following example returns `true`:

    ```js
    console.log(expression1 && !expression2);
    ```

  * When we remove `!` negation from the first expression, it returns `true`. Because one of the expressions now evaluates to `true`, the following example returns `true`: 

    ```js
    console.log( expression1 || expression2);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between `==` and  `===`? 

  * üôã The comparison `==` evaluates equality of value while `===` evaluates if value and type are equal. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between `&&` and  `||`? 

  * üôã The logical operator `&&` returns true if both expressions are `true` while the logical operator `||` returns true if one expression or the other returns `true`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use a logical operator to negate an expression? 

  * üôã Using the `!` operator adds a `not`. So an expression that returns `true`, returns `not true` or `false` and vice-versa.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on expressions and operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Conditional Statements (5 min) 

* Open `09-Ins_Conditional-Statements\script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë In the beginning of class, we talked about how one of the many things JavaScript can do is add decision-making to your code. That decision-making can be done using conditional statements. 

  * To give us some values to work with in the code, let's start by declaring variables using `var` and assigning them values using the assignment operator `=`, as shown in the following example:

      ```js
      var hungerLevel = 50;
      var isLunchTime = true;
      var lunchBill = 11;
      ```

  * üîë For the first `if` statement, we will also need an expression to evaluate. Using the value stored in the variable `hungerLevel` and the conditional operator `>=` we can create the expression `hungerLevel >= 50`. This expression, shown in the following snippet, will return `true` because the value of `hungerLevel` is currently `50`:

    ```js
    hungerLevel >= 50
    ```

  * üîë Now we are ready to write the `if` statement. We start by writing `if` in lowercase letters (This is important, using `IF` can result in an error). Then in parentheses `()`, we put the expression we want to be evaluated. We are evaluating `hungerLevel >= 50` in the following example:

    ```js
    if (hungerLevel >= 50)
    ```

  * üîë Next, we want something to happen if the condition is met, or `hungerLevel >=50` evaluates to `true`. To do this we add curly brackets `{}` and inside of the curly brackets, the action we want to happen. In the following example, if the expression `hungerLevel >=50` evaluates to `true`, then we want the message `"Hungry`" logged to the console:

    ```js
    if (hungerLevel >= 50) {
    console.log("Hungry!");
    }
    ```

  * üîë The action will only be executed if the expression evaluates to `true`. Because `hungerLevel >= 50` evaluates to `true`, the message `"Hungry!"` will log to the console. However, if we change the expression to one that evaluates to `false` like `hungerLevel < 50`, as follows, then nothing will log:

    ```js
    if (hungerLevel < 50) {
    console.log("Hungry!");
    }
    ```

  * üîë If we want one action to be performed if an expression evaluates to `true` and another action to be performed if the expression evaluates to `false`, then we can use an `else` statement. If `isLunchTime === true` evaluates to `true`, then `"Lunchtime"` will log. Else, `"Not Lunchtime"` will log, as follows:

    ```js
    if (isLunchTime === true) {
    console.log("Lunchtime");
    } else {
    console.log("Not Lunchtime");
    }
    ```

  *  This is another way to write the same statement. Instead of writing `isLunchTime === true`, we can simply write `isLunchTime`. Because `isLunchTime` has the value of `true`, `"Lunchtime!!"` will log to the console in the following example:

      ```js
      if (isLunchTime) {
      console.log("Lunchtime!!");
      } else {
      console.log("Not Lunchtime!!");
      }
      ```

  * üîë The `!` logical operator can also be used to negate the expression. Because `!Lunchtime` evaluates to false when we add`!`, `"It's Lunchtime Already !!` is logged in the following example:

    ```js
    if (!isLunchTime) {
    console.log("Not Lunchtime Already!!");
    } else {
    console.log("It's Lunchtime Already !!");
    }
    ```

  * üîë We can also use `else if` to test more than one condition. If the first condition evaluates to `true`, then the first action is executed. Otherwise, the second condition is tested, and so on. This process continues until a condition evaluates to `true` and the associated action is executed, as follows:

    ```js 
    if (lunchBill < 10) {
    console.log("Cost Rating: $");
    } else if (lunchBill >= 10 && lunchBill < 15) {
    console.log("Cost Rating: $$");
    ```

  * If none of the conditions evaluate to true, then the action after `else` is executed, as follows:

    ```js 
    } else {
    console.log("Cost Rating: $$$");
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens if an `if` statement evaluates to `true`?

  * üôã The action contained in the curly bracket is performed.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens if an `if` statement evaluates to `false`?

  * üôã Nothing. The action in the curly brackets is not performed.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between an `if` statement and an `else` statement? 

  * üôã An `if` statement executes an action only if the expression evaluates to `true`. An `else` statement executes an action only if the condition evaluates to `false`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/README.md`.

# üèóÔ∏è Create an Algorithm Using Conditional Statements

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will take in two expressions and evaluate if both expressions evaluate to `true`, only one expression evaluates to `true`, or both expressions evaluate to `false`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the message "True ‚úÖ True ‚úÖ" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are true.

* It is done when the message "True ‚úÖ False ‚ùå" is logged when `expression1` is true. 

* It is done when the message "False ‚ùå True ‚úÖ" is logged when `expression2` is true. 

* It is done when the message "False ‚ùå False ‚ùå" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are false. 

## üí° Hints

Do you have a plan? Before writing your algorithm, it is helpful to write out a plan in plain language that describes how you will use JavaScript to get it done. 

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

### 17. Instructor Review: Conditional Statements (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with conditional statements? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * üîë To create the conditional statement, we start with `if` and place `expression1 && expression2` in parentheses `()`. The action we want to be performed if the condition evaluates to `true` is written inside curly brackets `{}`. In this case we want to log to the console `True ‚úÖ True ‚úÖ`, as follows:

    ```js
    if(expression1 && expression2) {
    console.log("True ‚úÖ True ‚úÖ");
    ```

  * üîë If `expression1 && expression2` evaluates to `true`, then `True ‚úÖ True ‚úÖ`is logged and no other conditions are evaluated. If not, then the second condition is tested.

  * üîë The second condition tests if `expression1` is true. So we place `expression1` in the parentheses, as follows: 

    ```js
    } else if (expression1) {
    ```

  * If `expression1` evaluates to `true`, then `True ‚úÖ False ‚ùå` is logged and no other conditions are evaluated. If `expression1` does not evaluate to true, the next condition is tested, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    } else if (expression1) {
      console.log("True ‚úÖ False ‚ùå");
    ```

  * The process repeats again for the remaining `else if` condition. If `expression2` evaluates to `true`, then `False ‚ùå True ‚úÖ` is logged. At this point, all the conditions have been tested, as follows:

    ```js
    } else if (expression2) {
      console.log("False ‚ùå True ‚úÖ");
    ```

  * üîë If none of the conditions evaluate to `true` after all have been tested, then the action following `else` will execute. In this case, `False ‚ùå False ‚ùå` will log to the console, as follows: 

    ```js
    } else {
      console.log("False ‚ùå False ‚ùå");
    ```

  * üîë The action that is performed depends on the values inputted for the variables `x`, `expression1` and `expression2`. Because `x` has a value of `50`, both `expression1` and`expression2` currently evaluate to `false`. So because none of the conditions are `true`, in the following example, the expected action is that `False ‚ùå False ‚ùå` is logged: 

    ```js
    var x = 50;
    var expression1 = (x < 25);
    var expression2 = (x > 50);
    ```

* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to explain the following: 

  * Because both `expression1` and `expression2` evaluate to `false`, `False ‚ùå False ‚ùå` logs to the console. However if the inputs change, the action performed might change.

* Encourage the students to experiment with changing the values of `x`, `expression1` and `expression2` on their own to learn more about how changing the input will change the action performed. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do you think conditional statements might allow decision-making in code? 

  * üôãConditional statements allow you to carry out different actions based on conditions. Only if the condition evaluates to `true`, is the action performed.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on if...else](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
