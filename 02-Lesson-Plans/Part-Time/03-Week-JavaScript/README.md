# Unit 03 Instructor Overview: Intro to JavaScript

## Overview

In this unit, you will introduce students to the fundamentals of JavaScript  including variables, primitive types, arrays, and objects. You will also use logical and comparison operators to construct conditional statements and guide students as they write their first functions and algorithms. 

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/03-JavaScript/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* This will be the first time some of the students are introduced to programming fundamentals and the JavaScript language. Encourage students by letting them know that the skills learned during this week will be used again and again and the syntax will become more familiar with practice. 

* This is also a good opportunity for students to practice pseudocoding. If students are struggling with an activity, encourage them to talk it out in plain language with their partner. This will not only help them reinforce their fundamental understanding of JavaScript and gain clarity but also build the problem-solving skills needed to be successful JavaScript developers. 

* Take a few moments before class to get familiar with the various ways to access [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on different machines so that you can talk students through the process of opening up the console easily on Mac and Windows setups.

* There is a lot of new material in this week's lessons. If students feel overwhelmed, remind them that each activity builds on one another and they can look back at previous activities for guidance. 

## Career Connection

Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [supplemental folder](../../../01-Class-Content/03-JavaScript/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

## Heads-Up

Next unit, we will work with Web APIs. To preview the material, point out the students have already worked with the methods `console.log()`, `alert()`,  `confirm(),` and `prompt()`. Then, note that these methods are just a few of the huge list of Web API methods available to JavaScript developers.
