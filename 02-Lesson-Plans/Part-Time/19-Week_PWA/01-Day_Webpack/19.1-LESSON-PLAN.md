# 19.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Webpage Performance and Webpack

## Overview

In this class, you will introduce webpage performance and optimization, key aspects of a Progressive Webpage or PWA. Lighthouse, a PWA analysis tool, is used to introduce students to the key metrics needed to build a PWA experience for users. Then using webpack, a static module bundler for JavaScript applications, students will learn to optimize both JavaScript and CSS files. Additional performance improvements, including lazy loading, are also covered. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Lighthouse` through `10-Stu_Webpack-Plugin`.

* For the Lighthouse activity, you will use both DevTool's built-in Lighthouse audit tool and the Chrome Lighthouse extension. Please be sure to install the [Chrome Lighthouse extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en) prior to class and add the Lighthouse icon to your toolbar. 

* You will use webpack for the majority of today's activities. The activities only use the front end; there is no back end in any of the activities. If you are unfamiliar with webpack, please refer to the [webpack documentation](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/).

* Today's activities take students through setting up a webpack app step-by-step. As a result, for the majority of activities, you will be required to manually insert an `index.html` into the generated `dist` file and update the script's src attribute to the output filename. In the final activity of the day, students learn to add both the `index.html` file and generate a separate CSS file using webpack plugins. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo and to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify key Lighthouse metrics and how they impact an app's performance.

* Explain the role of entry points and output properties in webpack bundling.

* Configure webpack using webpack.config.js file. 

* Bundle CSS and image assets

* Use webpack loader to add Babel to ensure compatibility with older browers.

* Generate an `index.html` file and separate CSS file using webpack plugins.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mkVX8q7pIQM6giW6ArxB2pjAYFCp2BpjIu1x7MDR6dE/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **What is a PWA?**: PWA is a design pattern.

    * A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a design pattern that uses web technologies to build a fast, flexible web application that will perform like a native app on any device.

  * **Are PWAs dependent on a specific technology?**

  * **PWAs are focused on optimizations, not specific tech.**

    * PWAs do not rely on a single, specific technology. Instead, they use a variety of tools to build and optimize web applications to take advantage of features already available on the user’s device and browser.

  * **A PWA Is an Optimized Web App**

    * A PWA is simply a web app built using standard technologies that works in a browser and is optimized to improve performance and user experience.

  * **What makes an app a PWA?**

  * **PWA Design Pattern Optimizations**

    * PWA are optimized to be fast.

    * PWAs are optimized to work offline.

    * PWAs are installable by users directly on their devices.

    * PWAs are secure.

  * **PWAs Are Fast**

    * To give the user the look and feel of a native app, assets are bundled. This gives users a faster, more performant app.

  * **PWAs Work Offline**

    * A PWA also uses a service worker, which allows a user to access visited pages even if the app is offline.

  * **PWAs Are Installable**

    * A PWA uses a special set of instructions for the browser called a manifest.json, which adds a splash screen and makes the app installable directly on the user’s device.

  * **PWAs Are Secure**

    * A PWA works on a secure connection to help keep users and their data safe.

  * **What are the key benefits of PWAs?**

  * **Key Benefits of PWAs**

    * PWA is an adaptable design pattern with principles that can be applied to any web application.

    * PWAs focus on optimizing web applications to be faster and more performant.

    * PWAs enhance web applications by taking advantage of the user’s browser capability to provide a native app experience on any device.

    * PWAs are cost effective! With PWAs, there is no need to build a separate mobile and desktop application. A single app works for all devices.

    * PWAs can be directly installed by the user. There is no need for costly app stores!

    * PWAs deliver the speed and features that users expect in a modern app.

  * **Mini-Project**: The mini-project for this unit will be a contact directory app that uses service workers, IndexedDB, webpack, and has PWA functionality. We will also deploy the app to Heroku.

* Navigate to `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in your command line and run  run `npm install` and `npm start`.

* Open `http://localhost:3000/` in the browser to demonstrate the following: 

  * For the mini-project, we will build a contact directory app that allows us to create contact cards containing individual contact's information.

  * When we add contact information to a form and click `submit`, a new card is created. 

* Open Chrome DevTools in the browser and navigate to the `Network` tab to demonstrate the following;

  * Using Chrome DevTools, we can simulate an offline experience by setting the `Throttling` option to `Offline.`

  * We can then refresh the page to see what the app looks like when offline. 

  * Since we added offline functionality using a service worker, even when offline, we can still see the contact card we just created.  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning about PWAs, a design pattern that allows us to built apps reliable, installable, and have offline capabilities. 

  * ☝️ How does this project build on or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will be using CRUD operations to persist and delete data using an in-browser database. We will set up an Express.js server to display the user interface.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 PWAs are used by companies both large and small to build a single app works for all devices and have the capabilities and fast performance demanded by modern users. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Lighthouse (5 min)

* Navigate to `10-Stu_Webpack-Plugin/Solved` in your terminal and run `npm install` and `npm run build` to create a `dist` folder. 

* Open the `10-Stu_Webpack-Plugin/Solved/dist/index.html` using Live Server to demonstrate the following: 

  * We can audit an app's performance using a tool called Lighthouse using either the Chrome Extension on DevTools. 

  * To use Google DevTools to inspect our app, we click on the double arrows `>>` and select `Lighthouse`.

  * Lighthouse allows us to perform a number of audits aimed at providing metrics to help improve both overall performance and accessibility. For now, we will select `Performance` and run a test on the `Desktop` version.

  * We click `Generate Report` to start the audit. 

  * The report contains a number of metrics that show how fast the page loads and users can interact with the app. It looks like our optimized app is performing well! 

  * We can toggle the expanded view to see details and information about each metric as well as insights on how to improve the score. 
  
  * When we scroll down the page to the `Passed Audits`, we can also see that the improvements we will make during today's class have paid off. All audits are passing and bundling our files has reduced our payload and increased our app's speed. 

  * DevTools is just one way of using Lighthouse. Lighthouse is also available as an Chrome extension and as a node module for use during development. During the first activity, we will use another Lighthouse tool, the Chrome extension, to explore metrics. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use Lighthouse to audit our app's performance?

  * 🙋 We use Lighthouse to generate an audit report that provides key metrics about how fast our page loads and how quickly it is interactive to the user. The audit report also provides an explanation of each metric as well as insights to help see where our app is performing well and where we may need to make improvements. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Lighthouse/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Lighthouse (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Lighthouse/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Conduct a Lighthouse Audit of PWA

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As an developer, I want to review the performance metrics of a deployed PWA application using Lighthouse's Chrome extension.  

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have installed the [Chrome Lighthouse extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en)

  * It's done when I have navigated to `https://mini-project-lighthouse.herokuapp.com/` in a Chrome browser. 

  * It's done when I have used the Chrome Lighthouse extension to generate an audit report. 

  * It's done when I have selected `Expand View` and have clicked on the link to each key metric and reviewed the provided information. 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can use run Lighthouse through the command line or install as a node module?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Lighthouse (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Lighthouse? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ First Contentful Paint

  * ✔️ Time to Interactive

  * ✔️ PWA Audit

* Navigate to `https://mini-project-lighthouse.herokuapp.com/` in your browser to explain the following:

  * The Chrome Lighthouse extension is another way of generating a performance audit report and is especially useful for auditing apps that have already been deployed.

  * This app is an example of the mini-project we will complete by the end of this unit deployed to Heroku. Using the Lighthouse Chrome extension, we can take a look to see how our deployed app is performing and what improvements we may want to make. 

* Open the Lighthouse extension by clicking in the icon in the toolbar and click on `Generate Report` to explain the following:

  * When we look at the performance metrics in our report, it looks like our app is performing well. Let's take a closer look at a few key metrics. 

  * We click on `Expand View` to get more information about the metrics.

  * The `First Contentful Paint` is the time it takes before the first image or text appear on our page. It is important a page 'paints' quickly so that the user does not lose interest in our app due to a slow load time. 

  * The `Time to Interactive` is another key metric. It evaluates the time it takes for our app to be usable by our user. It is important our users can start doing things -- such a clicking a button -- quickly to retain users. 

  * While our app is performing well, it looks like one performance metric is not passing. One great thing about Lighthouse is that by clicking on a failing metric -- such as the `Cumulative Layout Shift` -- we can gain insights into the metric as well as information that can help us implement improvements in our own apps.  

  * In addition to performance metrics, Lighthouse also audits how the app is functioning as a PWA. 
  
  * When we scroll down further in the audit report, we see there is a section called `PWA` that lists key PWA optimizations. 

  * It looks like our app has a functioning service worker and a detectable `manifest.json` making it installable. That's great because installibity is a key feature of a PWA! 

  * It also looks like most PWA optimizations are already in place. To make further improvements, we can click on an optimization shown as failing for further information.   

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why is conducting a Lighthouse audit important when building a PWA?

  * 🙋 A PWA must be fast! A Lighthouse audit provides key information on how our app is performing as well as identifying key areas that can help further improve our app. Lighthouse also provides an audit of how our app is functioning as a PWA, including if the app is installable and the PWA optimizations made.  

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Google docs on Lighthouse performance scoring](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Webpack Intro (5 min)

* Open `03-Ins_Webpack-Intro/src` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Webpack is a static module bundler that takes our raw code and bundles it to optimize performance in a web browser. The primary purpose of webpack is to bundle JavaScript modules, but we can also use it for other file types. 

  * Before we setup webpack in our app, we first have to make a change to our code. Previously, we stored our images, CSS, and JavaScript in an `asset` folder. Now, we will place all our raw code into a source or **`src`** file.  Source files are used to store code that will be minified. For now, this is just our JavaScript files. 

* Open `03-Ins_Webpack-Intro/src/index.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * It is also important to set up a primary `index.js` file to serve as an **entry point** into our app. This entry point is used to help webpack determine which other modules and libraries the app depends on to run and build a dependency graph, or map of all the dependencies needed for the app. 

* Open `03-Ins_Webpack-Intro/package.json` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * To install webpack, we need to initialize our app as a node project if we haven't already done so and add `webpack` and `webpack-cli` as a dev dependency using the script `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`. This will add it to the `package.json` as shown in the following code:

  ```js
  "devDependencies": {
    "webpack": "^5.64.4",
    "webpack-cli": "^4.9.1"
  }
  ```

  * We are also going to add a shortcut script so we can run webpack with the command `npm run build`.

    ```js
    "build": "webpack"
    ```

* Open `03-Ins_Webpack-Intro/src/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Once we have installed webpack and added our shortcut script to our `package.json`, we add a `webpack.config.js` file that will allow us to provide configuration and setup instructions for our app. 

  * We set the **input** to the `index.js` file we have included in our `src` directory and the **output** filename to `main.js` and the path to `dist`. Now, when webpack build script is run, a `dist` folder will be created and the JavaScript files found in our `src` file will be bundled into a new file called `main.js`. 

  * We also set the mode to `development` to optimize our build for the development environment. 

    ```js
    module.exports = {
      mode: 'development',
      entry: './src/js/index.js',
    output: {
      filename: 'main.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
      },
    };
    ```

* Navigate to `03-Ins_Webpack-Intro` from the command line and run `npm install` and `npm run build` to demonstrate the following:

  * We can now use our shortcut script `npm run build` to compile our JavaScript and create a `dist` folder.

  * Before we can run our code though, we need to do one more thing. The `dist` folder contains only JavaScript. So for now, let's manually copy our `index.html` from the root of our project into the `dist` folder.

* Open `03-Ins_Webpack-Intro/dist/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Now in our copied `index.html` file, we update the path so it looks for the script files at `main.js` the name of our output file. 

    ```js
    <script src="main.js"></script>
    ```
    
  * Open `03-Ins_Webpack-Intro/dist/index.html` in your browser using Live Server and demonstrate the following:

  * Now, when we click on the button, we can see our compiled JavaScript at work! 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the role of the src folder?

  * 🙋 The src or source folder contains the raw, source files that we want to bundle. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Webpack-Intro/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Webpack Intro (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Webpack-Intro/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of webpack Setup

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved/index.html](./Unsolved/index.html), [Unsolved/src/index.js](./Unsolved/src/index.js), and [Unsolved/src/box.js](./Unsolved/src/box.js)

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation: 

  [webpack docs on getting started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/)

  ---

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is a dependency graph? How can understanding a dependency graph help developers write leaner, more performant code? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Webpack Intro (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with setting up webpack?

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `webpack.config.js`

  * ✔️ `src`

  * ✔️ `index.js`

  * ✔️ `export` 

  * ✔️ `main.js`

* Open `04-Stu_Webpack-Intro/Solved/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 When we setup webpack, we need set an entry point and a output property. For our app, our entry point is the `index.js` file in our `src` folder, the directory where the files we want bundled are placed. Our files will be outputted to a `dist` directory. Inside the `dist` directory, our bundled JavaScript will be written in the `main.js` file. 

    ```js
    module.exports = {
     mode: 'development',
     entry: './src/js/index.js',
     output: {
      filename: 'main.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
     },
    };
    ```

* Open `04-Stu_Webpack-Intro/Solved/src/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 The `index.js` file in our `src` folder serves as webpack's entry point. The entry point is the first file that webpack will look to when creating a bundle. To make sure that our JavaScript modules are included in our bundle, we import them into the `index.js` file so they are a dependency of our entry point file. 

    ```js
    import { boxClick } from "./box";
    import {headerClick} from "./header";
    ```

* Open `04-Stu_Webpack-Intro/Solved/src/box.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * In order to import a JavaScript function, we first have to export it using an export statement. An export statement allows the code in one file to be imported and used in another file as a dependency.  

    ```js
    export const boxClick = () => {
      const box = document.getElementById("box");
        if (box.style.backgroundColor === "blue") {
          box.style.backgroundColor ="yellow";
        } else {
        box.style.backgroundColor = "blue";
      }
    }
    ```

* Open `04-Stu_Webpack-Intro/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * For now, we will manually copy the `index.html` to the `dist` folder after the build. But we need to make one change. The script change must be updated to the output filename, or `main.js`.  Also, notice that the CSS is currently embedded in the HTML. In the next activity, we will learn how to give CSS a file of its own. 

* Navigate to `04-Stu_Webpack-Intro` from the command line and run `npm install` and `npm run build` to demonstrate the following:

  * We use the script `npm run build` to compile our JavaScript and create a `dist` folder.

  * Then, we copy our `index.html`from the root of our project into the `dist` folder, making sure we updated the script's src attribute to `main.js`.

    ```js
    <script src="main.js"></script>
    ```

* Open `04-Stu_Webpack-Intro/Solved/dist/index.html` in your browser using Live Server and demonstrate the following:

  * We can now click the buttons to see the header and box colors change in the app using the bundled JavaScript code. 
  
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

 * ☝️ What is the role of the entry point?

  * 🙋 The entry point is the JavaScript file, usually named `index.js` that serves as place where webpack will look first to build out the bundle and find dependent modules and assets. To be included in the bundle, the module must be a dependency of our entry point! 

 * ☝️ What is the role of the output property?

  * 🙋 The output property defines where on how and where webpack should output your JavaScript bundles and other assets. Typically, we output to a directory named 'dist'. Inside the `dist` directory bundled files, such as a `main.js` will be outputted. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋  We can refer to supplemental material, read the [webpack docs on entry and output ](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/#entry), [webpack docs on getting started](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/),and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Webpack Bundle (5 min)

* Open `05-Ins_Webpack-Bundle/src/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In the last activity to add styling to our app, we embedded CSS directly into our HTML file. However, a better solution is to add a CSS file into the `src` file and add the CSS rules in its own, separate file, as shown in this file. 

  * Simply adding the CSS file to the `src` file, though, is not enough to include it in the bundle. We will also need to do some work to configure webpack to handle our CSS files. 

* Open `05-Ins_Webpack-Bundle/package.json` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In the package.json, we have installed two new devDependencies used to handle CSS files, `css-loader` and `style-loader` using the script `npm install --save-dev style-loader css-loader`. For each file type we want to include in our bundle, a different loader or built-in asset module is used, so it is important to consult the docs! 

    ```js
    "devDependencies": {
      "css-loader": "^6.5.1",
      "style-loader": "^3.3.1",
      "webpack": "^5.64.4",
      "webpack-cli": "^4.9.1"
    }
    ```

* Open `05-Ins_Webpack-Bundle/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Once installed, we add a rule to our config file, to instruct webpack to use these loaders to handle CSS.

    ```js
    module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
     ],
    }
    ```

  * Since our output will now contain both JavaScript and CSS, we also change the name of our output file to `bundle.js`.

    ```js
     output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    ```
    
* Open `05-Ins_Webpack-Bundle/src/js/index.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * For our CSS to be included in our JavaScript bundle, we must import the CSS file into our entry point file, or `index.js`.

    ```js
    import '../css/style.css'
    ```
* Navigate to `05-Ins_Webpack-Bundle` from the command line and run `npm install` and `npm run build` to demonstrate the following:

  * We use the script `npm run build` to compile our JavaScript and create a `dist` folder.

* Open `05-Ins_Webpack-Bundle/dist/` in your IDE to demonstrate the following: 

  * Notice that there is no separate CSS file. The CSS has been bundled with the JavaScript file in `bundle.js`. 

  * To test our CSS is working, we copy our `index.html` from the root of our project into the `dist` folder, making sure that the script's src attribute is updated to `bundle.js`.

    ```js
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
    ```
* Open `05-Ins_Webpack-Bundle/dist/index.html` in your browser using Live Server and demonstrate the following:

  * When we open the app in the browser, the app works and is styled as expected. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we bundle non-JavaScript files using webpack? 

  * 🙋 One of the key features of webpack is that not only JavaScript files can be bundled. Instead, any file with a loader or built-in asset module be added as dependencies and bundled. To bundle non-JavaScript resources, we can go to the docs, find the loader or built-in asset module and then add a rule to our config file to handle the file type. Finally, we add the file we want to bundle as an import into our entry point file. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Webpack-Bundle/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Webpack Bundle (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Webpack-Bundle/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  # 📖 Bundle Images Using webpack

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to incorporate images into my webpack bundle so that they display on my app.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have updated the `webpack.config.js` file to handle image assets.

  * It's done when I have imported images into the `index.js` and `box.js` files as `Blue` and `Yellow`. 

  * It's done when I have set the `#box` element's src to `Yellow` to provide a default image when the page loads. 

  * It's done when I use `npm i` and `npm run build` to successfully build a `dist` folder and manually add the `index.html` file. 

  * It's done when I open the `dist/index.html` in the browser using Live Server and the images are displayed in the app.  

  ## 📝 Notes

  Refer to the documentation: 

  [webpack docs on loading images](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-images)

  ## Assets

  The following images demonstrate the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Screenshot showing app displaying blue robot](./assets/displaying-blue-robot.png)

  ![Screenshot showing app displaying yellow robot](./assets/displaying-yellow-robot.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * When webpack bundles the asset it changes the asset name to a string of numbers and letters like this: `29822eaa871e8eadeaa4.png`. How do we access this bundled image in our project? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can we use webpack's asset management to bundle fonts and data? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```
* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Webpack Bundle (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with adding non-JavaScript assets to our webpack bundle? 

 * Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Built-in Asset Module

  * ✔️ Image rules

  * ✔️ import alias

* Open `08-Stu_Webpack-Loader/Solved/webpack.config.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 To add images or icons to our bundle, we can use a built-in Asset Module. Since it is built-in, there are no packages to import. 

  * 🔑 In the config file, we add a new set of rules to handle images using the Asset Module. This will allow webpack to handle images. 

    ```js
     {
        test: /\.(png|svg|jpg|jpeg|gif)$/i,
        type: 'asset/resource',
      }
    ```

* Open `08-Stu_Webpack-Loader/Solved/src/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We import our images into the module where they will be used. Since we want to display the yellow robot image in the box when the page loads, we import the image into the `index.js` and give it an alias of `Yellow`.

    ```js
    import Yellow from '../images/yellow-robot.png';
    ```

  * 🔑 This alias `Yellow` is important because it is how we refer to the image path in our code. To set the image in the box to be the yellow robot, we simply the src to `Yellow`. This will allow webpack to find our image even after the code has been bundled. 

    ```js
    document.getElementById("box").src = Yellow;
    ```

* Open `08-Stu_Webpack-Loader/Solved/src/box.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * The exported function `boxClick` uses the image aliases `Yellow` and `Blue` to set the box's src attribute. This has been prewritten for us. 

    ```js
    export const boxClick = () => {
      const box = document.getElementById("box");
      if (box.src === Yellow) {
        box.src = Blue;
      } else {
         box.src = Yellow;
      }
    }
    ```

   * We import the yellow and blue robot images as `Yellow` and `Blue` into the `box.js` file to make the images available to the function. Since this module is imported into the entry point as a dependent, the images will also be included in the bundle. 

    ```js
    import Yellow from '../images/yellow-robot.png';
    import Blue from '../images/blue-robot.png';
    ```
* Navigate to `06-Stu_Webpack-Bundle/Solved` from the command line and run `npm install` and `npm run build` to demonstrate the following:

  * We use the script `npm run build` to compile our JavaScript and create a `dist` folder.

* Open `06-Stu_Webpack-Bundle/Solved/dist/` in your IDE to demonstrate the following: 

  * Notice that there are now two new image files with names that are a long string of letters and numbers. We can click on the images in our IDE to see they are actually our yellow and blue robot images. By assigning these images `Yellow` and `Blue` aliases in our code, webpack assigns the final url of that image after processing to the aliases automatically.  

  * To test our generated images are now working in our code, we copy our `index.html` from the root of our project into the `dist` folder, making sure that the script's src attribute is updated to `bundle.js`.

    ```js
    <script src="bundle.js"></script>
    ```
* Open `06-Ins_Webpack-Bundle/Solved/dist/index.html` in your browser using Live Server and demonstrate the following:

  * When we open the app in the browser, the app works and our yellow and blue robots appear. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use webpack's built-in Asset Module to load images? 

  * 🙋 We add rules in our config file to handle the images and then import the images -- using aliases -- into the modules where the images will be used. Webpack will automatically match the alias to the final url of the image after processing, making it easy to refer to the image's file path with just the alias in our code. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [webpack docs on loading images ](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-management/#loading-images), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Webpack Loader (5 min)

* Open `07-Ins_Webpack-Loader/assets/js/app.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We are using async/await to retrieve the subtract calculation in the `submit` function.

    ```js
    async function submit(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      const total = await subtract(Number(balanceEl.innerText), priceEl.value);
      balanceEl.innerText = total;
      addToList(expenseEl.value, priceEl.value);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 In order to maintain functionality of this code on older browsers such as Internet Explorer or Chrome version 57, we must use Babel to transpile our code to an older version of JavaScript that these older browsers can understand.

  * Open `07-Ins_Webpack-Loader/webpack.config.js` in your IDE to reveal the following.

    ```js
    entry: {...
    output: {...
    mode: {...
    module: {
      // Loaders
    }
    ```
  * A new property named `module` has been created.

  * Within the `module` property, we will add the `rules` array, which will contain a collection of loaders.

  * Loaders will extend webpack's bundling ability beyond JavaScript to other static assets such as style sheets.

    ```js
    module: {
      rules: [
        {
          test: /\.css$/i,
          use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
        },
    ```

  * Notice in the `test` property, a regex is used to find the style sheets in the application.

  * Navigate to `07-Ins_Webpack-Loader` in the terminal to install these two loaders as `devDependencies`.

    ```sh
    npm install -D css-loader style-loader
    ```

  * Open `07-Ins_Webpack-Loader/assets/js/app.js` and examine the following at the top of the file.

    ```js
    import '../css/style.css';
    ```

  * Note that there is no `<link>` element in the `index.html` to connect the `style.css` file.

  * The `css-loader` and `style-loader` now link the style sheet through the bundle import statement.

  * Navigate to `07-Ins_Webpack-Loader` in the terminal and run `npm i && npm run watch` to create the bundles.

  * Open `07-Ins_Webpack-Loader/index.html` in the browser to demonstrate that webpack is still styled through the webpack bundle.

  * We will add another loader to allow Babel to transpile modern JavaScript into an older version of JavaScript for older browsers.

    ```js
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/i,
        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
      },
      {
        test: /\.m?js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
            plugins: ['@babel/transform-runtime'],
          },
        },
      },
    ```

  * Note in the configuration above that the `node_modules` are excluded.

  * 🔑 The `babel-loader` uses a preset and a plugin option in order to transpile the modern JavaScript into an older-browser-friendly JavaScript version.

  * Install the following packages as `devDependencies` in the `07-Ins_Webpack-Loader` directory.

    * `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`

    * `@babel/core`

    * `@babel/preset-env`

    * `@babel/runtime`

    * `babel-loader`

  * 🔑 These packages support `babel-loader` and the preset and plugin options to transpile at runtime.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How does webpack know which files need to be loaded for the style sheets?

  * 🙋 In the `test` property, a regex is used to find the file extensions `.css`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Webpack-Loader/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: Webpack Loader (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Webpack-Loader/README.md`, which are also shown below.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🐛 "Get the Latest Interest" Button Does Not Work

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to use async/await with webpack.

  * As a user, I want to be able to get the latest interest rate when I click the appropriate button.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When I click the "Get the latest interest rate" button, an up-to-date interest rate should appear.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When a user clicks the "Get the latest interest rate" button, an error appears in the console.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

  1. At the command line, execute the command `npm install` to download the web app's dependencies.

  2. At the command line, execute the command `npm run watch` to create a bundle.

  3. Note the illegal operation error.

  ## Assets

  The following image confirms that a bundle was created by displaying a success message in the terminal:

  ![Get the latest interest rate button in the web application.](./Assets/interest-button.png)

  ![The latest interest rate is displayed on the web application.](./Assets/interest.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  Which plugins do we need for async/await to work in our browser?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What Babel plugin would allow object rest and spread operators to be used?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 14. Instructor Review: Webpack Loader (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with webpack loaders? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `path.resolve()`

  * ✔️ `dist`

* In the terminal, navigate to `08-Stu_Webpack-Loader/Unsolved` and run `npm i && npm run watch` to create the error. Examine the error to reveal the first bug.

  * The error message in the terminal indicates that the error is an illegal operation on a directory.  .

    ```sh
    [Error: EISDIR: illegal operation on a directory, mkdir '/'] {
      errno: -21,
      code: 'EISDIR',
      syscall: 'mkdir',
      path: '/'
    }
    ```

* 🔑 Navigate to the `08-Stu_Webpack-Loader/Solved/webpack.config.js` file and open in your IDE:

  * When we create a bundle, a directory is added to our code, the `dist` directory. We use `path.resolve()` to generate a `dist` folder that will hold our `index.html` and bundles. To run our app using the bundles, we will use the `index.html` inside the `dist` folder.

    ```js
    output: {
      filename: '[name].bundle.js',
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    },
    ```

  * Also notice that we need to properly configue Babel due to the async/await dependency:

    ```js
    {
      test: /\.m?js$/,
      exclude: /node_modules/,
      use: {
        loader: 'babel-loader',
        options: {
          presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          plugins: ['@babel/transform-runtime'], //insert the runtime
        },
      },
    },
    ```

* 🔑 Navigate to `08-Stu_Webpack-Loader/Solved/` in the terminal and run `npm install` and `npm run watch` to demonstrate that the error is now gone and the app is bundling as expected.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Do we need Babel to transpile our code in our current versions of Chrome?

  * 🙋 No, we don't, but companies whose customers use legacy systems might.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Babel docs on plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins), and attend Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Webpack Plugin (5 min)

* Navigate to `09-Ins_Webpack-Plugin` and run the commands `npm i && npm run watch`.

* Open `09-Ins_Webpack-Plugin/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Create an expense and submit it to see that this functionality is broken.

* Open `09-Ins_Webpack-Plugin/dist/index.html` in the browser and create another expense.

  * Now it works! But how?

* Open `09-Ins_Webpack-Plugin/webpack.config.js` and examine the following:

  * A new `plugin` property contains a new instance of the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` class configured to use the `index.html` file as a template.

  * It's also configured to use the title `Webpack Demo`.

    ```js
    mode: 'development',
    plugins: [
      new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: './index.html',
        title: 'Webpack Demo'
      }),
    ],
    ```

  * 🔑 Note that the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` module is imported at the top of the `webpack.config.js` file.

    ```js
    const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
    ```

* 🔑 Open the `09-Ins_Webpack-Plugin/package.json` and show that in the `devDependency` is the `html-webpack-plugin` package.

* Open the `09-Ins_Webpack-Plugin/index.html` file in the IDE and show that there is no `<script>` element to import the bundle.

  * The `title` is inserted through the `htmlWebpackPlugin` object.

    ```html
    <title><%= htmlWebpackPlugin.options.title %></title>
    ```

* Open the `09-Ins_Webpack-Plugin/dist/index.html` and examine the following:

  * Webpack has output an `index.html` file in the `dist/` folder using the `./index.html` in the root directory with the title from the `webpack.config.js` file and the dynamically named bundle.

  ```html
  <title>Webpack Demo</title>
  <script defer src="main.bundle.js"></script>
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When would the `HtmlWebpackPlugin` be highly useful?

  * 🙋 When there are many pages with lots of entry points and bundle names.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Webpack-Plugin`.
