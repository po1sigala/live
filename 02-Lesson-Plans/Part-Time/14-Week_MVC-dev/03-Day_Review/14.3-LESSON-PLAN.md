# 14.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Overview 

@TODO Write a two- or three-sentence overview of the lesson plan.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_MVC-Review` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* @TODO Every Instructor Notes block begins with the preceding bullet, which outlines the activities that will be covered during class.

* @TODO Empathize with the instructor. If you only had one hour to prepare for class, what are the things you would want to know up front? What are the potential pitfalls in class? Where are students going to get hung up? 

* @TODO Set the instructor up for success.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* @TODO Bullet the learning objectives for the lesson plan. Refer to your Activity Planner.

* @TODO When writing learning objectives, start each one with a measurable verb. Refer to this [list of measurable verbs used to assess learning outcomes](https://www.clinton.edu/curriculumcommittee/listofmeasurableverbs.cxml). For example, "Initialize projects and install third-party packages using npm."

* @TODO If a learning objective is a concept and not a demonstrable skill, use the verb "explain". For example, "Explain the client-server model."

* @TODO Do not use the verb "understand" because it is not measurable.

* @TODO Aim for 3&ndash;6 learning objectives. If you find yourself listing more than six, you may need to rethink the scope of your objectives or the lesson itself.
