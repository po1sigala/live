# 14.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Overview 

In today's class, students will have a chance to review MVC architecture, Handlebars.js, user authentication, and ESLint. Students will also be introduced to Prettier prior to starting on the mini project.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_MVC-Review` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be sure to have your MySQL server up and running. Go ahead and create the `user_db` and `crowdfund_db` databases ahead of time, or demonstrate it live in class.

* The first two activities and the mini project use a `.env` file. Make sure you create one or rename the existing `.env.EXAMPLE` file before demonstrating these activities.

* The activities also include a seeds script that can be executed with `npm run seed`.

* You'll need to install the ESLint and Prettier VS Code extensions to properly demonstrate both libraries.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Prettier` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the interactions between the Model, View, and Controller

* Implement user authentication in a Node.js app

* Explain the purpose of ESLint

* Explain and add Prettier to an existing project
