# 14.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Overview 

In today's class, students will have a chance to review MVC architecture, Handlebars.js, user authentication, and ESLint. Students will also be introduced to Prettier prior to starting on the mini project.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_MVC-Review` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be sure to have your MySQL server up and running. Go ahead and create the `user_db` and `crowdfund_db` databases ahead of time, or demonstrate it live in class.

* The first two activities and the mini project use a `.env` file. Make sure you create one or rename the existing `.env.EXAMPLE` file before demonstrating these activities.

* The activities also include a seeds script that can be executed with `npm run seed`.

* You'll need to install the ESLint and Prettier VS Code extensions to properly demonstrate both libraries.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Prettier` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the interactions between the Model, View, and Controller

* Implement user authentication in a Node.js app

* Explain the purpose of ESLint

* Explain and add Prettier to an existing project

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Congratulate the class on learning new back-end skills to complement their front-end skills. They now have everything they need to build full-stack applications!

* Remind students that the upcoming group project will involve putting all of these skills together to make something of their own choosing.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some apps that would require a database?

  * 🙋 An app for scheduling appointments, tracking fitness/financial progress, shopping, anything that requires users to create an account

  * ☝️ What's the benefit of having an app where users can create accounts?

  * 🙋 Their information is saved indefinitely and can be accessed across multiple devices (as opposed to `localStorage`)

  * ☝️ What content or features would you want to restrict to only logged in users?

  * 🙋 Your own dashboard/profile page, the ability to create public posts, the ability to interact with other users, etc.

  * ☝️ Thinking about your personal interests, what kind of account-based app would aid those interests?

  * 🙋 An app where you can share/favorite recipes, schedule meet-ups, discuss/review movies, trade collectibles, plan a trip, etc.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: MVC Review (5 min) 

* Navigate to `21-Ins_MVC-Review` and explain the following:

  * This is a full-stack application that follows MVC architecture.

  * There are folders labeled `models`, `views`, and `controllers` that contain the three main pieces of the application.

* Open `21-Ins_MVC-Review/models/User.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The Model is in charge of data-related logic. This particular model maps to a `user` table in the database.

* Open `21-Ins_MVC-Review/controllers/homeRoutes.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The Controller processes requests. In this case, our controller is an Express.js route that renders a Handlebars.js template.

* Open `21-Ins_MVC-Review/views/homepage.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The View represents what the user sees in the browser. Our views are built with Handlebars.js. However, they are currently rendering hardcoded test data.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this with real data?

  * 🙋 Run a Sequelize `findAll()` method in the controller and send the returned data to the Handlebars.js template.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_MVC-Review/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: MVC Review (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_MVC-Review/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Populate User Registry with Database Data

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a user, I want to see a list of other users who are registered with the app.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the homepage displays the user data from the database instead of the hardcoded values.

  * It's done when the user data is rendered as part of a Handlebars.js template.

  * It's done when the users are sorted alphabetically by name.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![The homepage displays a list of users and their e-mail addresses](./Images/01-user-registry.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * Without a signup form, how can you quickly add new users to the database?

  * What needs to happen with the Sequelize data before it can be passed into the Handlebars.js template?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some other paradigms besides MVC?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: MVC Review (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with MVC and Handlebars.js? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Sequelize serialization

  * ✔️ Handlebar.js expressions

* Open `21-Ins_MVC-Review/controllers/homeRoutes.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We perform a Sequelize `findAll()` to get the user data, excluding the users' passwords but ordering them by name.

    ```js
    const userData = await User.findAll({
      attributes: { exclude: ['password'] },
      order: [['name', 'ASC']],
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 We serialize the data to remove extraneous properties that Handlebars.js doesn't need.

    ```js
    const users = userData.map((project) => project.get({ plain: true }));
    ```

  * 🔑 We pass the serialized array of users into the `homepage.handlebars` template.

    ```js
    res.render('homepage', { users });
    ```

* Open `21-Ins_MVC-Review/views/homepage.handlebars` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We use a Handlebars.js `#each` helper to loop over the users and render a `<div>` element for each one.

    ```hbs
    {{#each users as |user| }}
    <div class="row align-center mb-5">
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h2>{{{get_emoji}}} {{user.name}}</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3><a href="mailto:{{user.email}}">{{user.email}}</a></h3>
      </div>
    </div>
    {{/each}}
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is another built-in helper that you can use with Handlebars.js?

  * 🙋 The `#if` helper.

  * ☝️ What is the difference between double and triple bracket expressions in Handlebars.js?

  * 🙋 Double brackets render text; triple brackets render HTML.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Sequelize Models documentation](https://sequelize.org/master/class/lib/model.js~Model.html) and the [Express Handlebars documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Auth Review (5 min) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

  # 🐛 Fix Project's ESLint Rules

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

  * As a developer, I don't want to see warnings when I use the `**` exponentiation operator.

  * As a developer, I want to discourage other team members from explicitly assigning variables to `undefined`.

  ## Expected Behavior

  The project's ESLint rules allow the use of `**` operators. 

  ESLint displays an error when variables are assigned to `undefined`. For example: `let x = undefined;` is unnecessary, because `let x;` on its own is sufficient.

  ## Actual Behavior

  ESLint displays an error when developers use `**` operators. For example: `let x = 5 ** 2;`.

  Developers are able to assign variables to `undefined` without any warning from ESLint.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. Run `npm install` to install the ESLint dependencies.

  2. Open `index.js` in VS Code.

  3. Note the underlined error on line 6.

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * How do you adjust the rules for an ESLint configuration?

  * In which version of JavaScript were `**` exponentiation operators introduced?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What are some other options you can add to your ESLint config file?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
