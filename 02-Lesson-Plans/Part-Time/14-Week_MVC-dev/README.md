# Unit 14 Instructor Overview: Model-View-Controller (MVC)

## Overview

In this unit, you will use the separation of concerns principle and the MVC framework to build out fullstack web apps. You will use Handlebars.js features including, expressions, built-in helpers, cutsom helpers, and partials to build static templates that can render dynamic data. You will use front end logic to make requests and pass data to the back end. You will begin by using hardcoded data and transition to using seed data with Sequelize and MySQL. You will use the routes in the Controller to manipulate data in the Model, to serialize Sequelize objects before sending them to the View, and create your own custom middleware for user authentication. You will also incorporate sessions and cookies using the Sequelize store. 

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/14-MVC-dev/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Take some time to read through the Handlebars.js docs to (re)familiarize yourself with the template engine. Focus on expressions, built-in helpers, custom helpers, and partials.

* This unit introduces students to the template engine, Handlebars.js. The intention is not so much for students to learn Handlebars.js because it will be useful in their career, but instead, it is an introduction to template engines, preparation for React.js, and a way to emphasize the MVC framework.

* You will be using MySQL for a few of today's activities. Be sure to have your MySQL server up and running. Go ahead and create the `dish_db` database ahead of time, or demonstrate it live in class.

* Starting with `07-Ins_Data-Serialization`, each activity requires a `.env` file. Make sure you create one or rename the existing `.env.EXAMPLE` file before demonstrating each activity.

* Be prepared to remind students how to start their MySQL server, starting with `08-Stu_Data-Serialization`.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/{XX-TITLE}/04-Career-Connection/README.md).
