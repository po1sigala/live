# 09.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Advanced ES6

## Overview 

This lesson plan will cover some additional topics related to ES6 syntax. Some of the tools covered include the `for...of` loop, rest operator, spread operator, and additional Git concepts.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_For_of` through `28-Stu_Mini-project`.

* This lesson covers some concepts that you might want to review to prepare for student questions:

  * [MDN Web Docs on for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)

  * [MDN Web Docs on spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

  * [MDN Web Docs on destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify and implement how and when to use `for...of` loops.

* Identify and implement how and when to use the spread and rest operators.

* Use destructuring assignment syntax to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into unique variables.

* Identify and implement how and when to fork a Git repository.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class and congratulate them on learning some of the most used ES6 syntax rules.

* Reassure students that learning new syntax can be time-consuming and difficult, but it won't always feel like that. Using these rules more will allow you to commit them to memory and use less mental bandwidth going forward.

* Explain that one of the best ways to learn these new rules is to use the newer syntax whenever possible. The old syntax is still perfectly valid, and students can always fall back on it.

* These newer syntax rules are not born in a vacuum. They are the result of years of revision by a standards organization called ECMA. It is important to have standards in web development to ensure maximum compatibility across a wide spectrum of web browsers.

* The ES in ES6 stands for **ECMAScript**. ECMAScript itself is a programming language, but as far as we are concerned, it is just a language from which syntax rules are inherited. We can find a more detailed history in the [Wikipedia article on ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).

### 2. Instructor Demo: for...of (5 min) 

* Open `21-Ins_For_Of/index.js` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` after commenting out the `.map` example. 

  * 🔑 Notice when we run the code that we see each value in the songs array, as follows:

    ```js
    const songs = ['Bad Guy', 'Old Town Road', '7 Rings'];

    for (const value of songs) {
        console.log(value);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 After we comment in the second example, we use a `for...of` loop to iterate over an object or map, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    const songs = new Map([['Bad Guy', 1], ['Old Town Road', 2]]);

    for (const [key, value] of songs) {
        console.log(`${key}'s chart position is ${value}`);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Explain that the `for...of` statement creates a loop iterating over objects, including `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `String`, `TypedArray`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How does the `for...of` seem to differ from a `forEach`?

  * 🙋 The `forEach` method only applies to arrays, while the `for...of` is much more flexible.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_For_Of/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: for...of (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_For_Of/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement and Use for...of Loops

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to use `for...of` loops to iterate through data inside objects.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have selected all the inside `#songs` elements in the `html`.

  * It's done when I have iterated through the song collection with a `for...of` loop and added a `class` of `red` to each element.

  ## 💡 Hints

  What part of the object is essential in setting up the iteration of a `for...of` loop?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How could you iterate through deeply nested objects?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: for...of (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the `for...of` loop? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `for...of`
  
  * ✔️ Iterator

* Open `22-Stu_For_Of/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 The syntax for the `for...of` loop reads very similar to plain English, which helps conceptualize what is happening in the program.

  * 🔑 The syntax is relatively straightforward. The key takeaway is knowing when to use and what to use it for.

  * When we open the `index.html` file, we notice that each line item in the unordered list has a green color.
  
  * This is the result of using the `for...of` loop to iterate over each line item and add the class of `green` to the class list for the given element, as follows:

    ```js
    const songs = document.querySelectorAll("ul > li");

    for (const song of songs) {
      song.classList.add("green");
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 If you forget the syntax, VS Code can help you create these types of loops by offering a snippet to work from. You can try it yourself by typing `forof` and simply pressing Enter, which will result in the following code:
    
    ```js
    for (const iterator of object) {
        
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do you know when to use a `for...of` loop?

  * 🙋 While it generally depends on the situation, `for...of` loops help most when you need to iterate through key-value pairs in an object.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Rest and Spread Operators (5 min) 

* Open `23-Ins_Rest_and_Spread/index.js` in your browser.

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 When we run the file, we get output for a few different operations: without the rest operator, with the rest operator, without spread, and with spread, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    function add(x, y) {
      return x + y;
    }

    console.log(add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) // => 3
    ```

  * Explain to the class that it is possible to call a function with any number of arguments, but only the first two will be counted.
  
  * Let's examine this function using the `rest` operator, as follows:

    ```js
    function add(...nums) {
      let sum = 0;
      for (let num of nums) sum += num;
      return sum;
    }

    add(1) // => 1
    add(3,3) // => 6
    add(1, 1, 4, 5) // => 11
    ```

  * In this example, we use a rest operator to collect all of the arguments into a `nums` array, enabling us to pass in as many arguments as we want.

  * Now let's review the following example:

    ```js
    function howManyArgs(...args) {
      return `You passed ${args.length} arguments.`; // point out the template literal
    }

    console.log(howManyArgs(0, 1)); // You have passed 2 arguments.
    console.log(howManyArgs("argument!", null, ["one", 2, "three"], 4)); // You have passed 4 arguments.
    ```

  * 🔑  The takeaway here is that variables are now available inside the array of the function. We can also pass as many in as we want.

  * 🔑  The spread operator allows iterables like arrays, objects, and strings to be expanded into single arguments or elements. 
  
  * You can compare this to pouring items out of a cup. The only difference is that the items are variables and the cup is an iterable.

  * In the following example, we have expanded both arrays into a new array with all of the elements:

    ```js
    // Spread Operator

    let dragons = ['Drogon', 'Viserion', 'Rhaegal'];
    let weapons = ['dragonglass', ...dragons, 'wildfire']; // notice the spread operator ...dragons

    console.log(weapons); // prints ["dragonglass", "Drogon", "Viserion", "Rhaegal", "wildfire"]

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why does the first example of the `add()` function only output `3`?

  * 🙋 Because only the first and second parameter get counted without the use of the rest operator.
  
  * ☝️ The syntax for spread and rest are similar, but what is the difference between the two?

  * 🙋 The rest operator allows us to pass in any number of arguments, while the spread operator allows us to spread out an iterable into unique variables.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Rest_and_Spread/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Rest and Spread Operators (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Rest_and_Spread/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement and Use Spread and Rest Operators

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to use the spread and rest operators to make my code easier to read.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have copied the `songs` array using spread `...`.

  * It's done when I have console logged the new array.

  * It's done wheen I have modified the `addition` function so that it retains functionality but also allows one to pass in any number of arguments.

  ## 💡 Hints

  Can you think of some real-life analogies for the spread and rest operator?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What other data types can you use the spread or rest operator on?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Spread and Rest Operators (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with spread and rest operators? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Spread syntax (`...`)

  * ✔️ Rest operator

  * ✔️ Multiple arguments

* Open `24-Stu_Rest_and_Spread/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 During this exercise we also used something called `reduce`, which is used in this case to calculate the sum of an array. Let's look at the [MDN Web Docs on reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) briefly before we review.

  * In the first example, we are using the spread operator to copy the items in `songs` to `new_songs`. Much like we would be dumping out the contents of a cup, we are populating the `new_songs` array with the items in `songs`, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    const songs = ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
    const new_songs = [...songs];

    console.log(new_songs); // => ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
    ```

* Next we modify the addition function to make use of the rest operator. This allows us to pass in as many arguments as we need. This is particularly useful in this case where we want to add as many numbers as necessary. The code should resemble the following example:

    ```js
    // unsolved version
    function addition(x, y, z) {
      const array = [x, y, z];
      return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    }
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6

    // solved using rest
    function addition(...array) {
      return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); // you don't have to change this line of code but look up reduce if you're not sure what it does here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
    }
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)); // 110
    ```

  * 🔑  There is a good chance that students might be confused on where spread and operators go, because they are very similar and can be used in similar situations. This is just an introduction; assure students that they will begin to pick up fluency as they get more practice.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does the reduce method help us with in this exercise?

  * 🙋 The reduce method reduces an array to a single value. It takes a callback function and runs that function for each value in the array starting from the left to the right.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) and the [MDN Web Docs on rest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Object Destructuring (5 min) 

* Open `25-Ins_ObjDestructuring/index.js` in your browser.

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 Notice that when we run the `index.js` file we see several variables logged to the terminal. Each of these are different ways of accessing variables inside an object.

  * 🔑 Also, in the file, we are using dot notation to access variables inside an object, as we have in the past. We are plucking off certain variables and setting them equal to the value of the object. This is done with curly braces on the left side of the equals sign, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const arya = {
      name: 'Arya Stark',
      parents: ['Eddard Stark', 'Catelyn Stark'],
    };

    const { name, parents } = arya;
    ```

  * You can now also use object destructuring as a way to pluck off certain variables from an object. Consider the following example:

    ```js
    const betterLogCharacter = ({ name, parents }) =>
    console.log(`${name}'s parents are: ${parents[0]} and ${parents[1]}.`);

    betterLogCharacter(jaime);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We could look up examples of object destructuring and get a feel for the logic before attempting the activity.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_ObjDestructuring/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Object Destructuring (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_ObjDestructuring/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement and Recognize Object Destructuring

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to know how to use destructuring assignment syntax to pluck out data from arrays or objects.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have opened `index.js` and reviewed the existing code.

  * It's done when I have used destructuring assignment syntax so that each `console.log` statement logs out the value properly.

  ## 💡 Hints

  You have likely seen destructuring more than you think in your everyday life as a developer. Is there an import statement that you can remember from a previous exercise that uses this syntax?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Write an object of your own and then log each key-value pair using object destructuring.

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 10. Instructor Review: Object Destructuring (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with object destructuring? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Object destructuring syntax

  * ✔️ Destructuring nested objects

* Open `26-Stu_ObjDestructuring/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 This exercise highlights how we can pluck off multiple properties at once, saving us a few lines of code.

  * 🔑 We can also destructure function parameters. This allows us to name them directly and again save a few steps.  

  * 🔑 Now we can simply expect an object and pull the properties off without worrying about the order they're passed in or writing extra code to destructure them the old way.

  * In the past, if we wanted to cherry-pick an object's properties, we'd have to do something like the following example:

    ```js
    const arya = {
      name: "Arya Stark",
      parents: ["Eddard Stark", "Catelyn Stark"]
    };

    const aryaName = arya.name; // "Arya Stark"
    const aryaParents = arya.parents; // ["Eddard Stark", "Catelyn Stark"]`
    ```

  * 🔑  With ES6 object destructuring syntax, the code will now resemble the following example:

    ```js
    const { name, parents } = arya;

    console.log(name); // prints `"Jaime Lannister"`
    console.log(parents); // prints `["Tywin Lannister", "Joanna Lannister"]`
    ```

  * We can also rename the destructured properties as follows:

    ```js
    const jaime = {
      name: "Jaime Lannister",
      parents: ["Tywin Lannister", "Joanna Lannister"]
    };

    const { name: jaimeName } = jaime;
    console.log(jaimeName); // prints `"Jaime Lannister"`
    ```

  * We can also handle nested objects in a much more elegant way, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const jon = {
      first: "Jon",
      last: "Snow",
      title: "Prince",
      family: {
        brothers: {
          brother1: "Rob Stark",
          brother2: "Rickon Stark"
        },
        sisters: {
          sister1: "Arya Stark",
          sister2: "Sansa Stark"
        }
      }
    };

    const { brother1, brother2 } = jon.family.brothers;
    console.log(brother1); // <= Rob Stark
    console.log(brother2); // <= Rickon Stark
    ```

  * 🔑  This also works with arrays, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const characters = ["Ned Stark", "The Quiet Wolf", "House Stark"];

    const [name, alias, allegiance] = characters;
    console.log(name, alias, allegiance); // <= Ned Stark The Quiet Wolf House Stark
    ```

  * You can also use destructuring with strings, like in the following code:

    ```js
    const skills = "The Usurper, Baratheon, Cersei"; // string of data

    const [alias, family, spouse] = skills.split(","); // set variables and split
    console.log(alias, family, spouse); // print them by variable name
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Does the order matter when passing destructured object properties into a function? 

  * 🙋 No! Because we are referring to the properties in the object by name, the key names will align with the correct value every time.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋  We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git_Fork/README.md`.

### 11. Everyone Do: Git Fork (20 min)

*  Open [Git docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Fork allows you to contribute to a repository that you don't have push access to. When you fork a project, GitHub will make an exact copy of the project that will live on your account that you can push to.
  
  * This workflow then allows you to create a pull request to the parent repository when you have finished your contributions. This is a very common workflow in many open source projects. 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git_Fork/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

* Open your browser and choose a repository to fork. Click the green fork button. 

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * After we clone the repository, we will want to visit our own fork and copy the Git URL to clone it the local machine, as follows:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:microsoft/vscode.git
    ```

  * 🔑 After you clone the local repository, run the following command to demonstrate that the remote is pointed to your namespace rather than the parent repository:

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    ```

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

### 12. BREAK (40 min)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min) 

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-project/README.md` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Notice that when we run the application, we are presented with a series of prompts by `inquirer`.

  * 🔑 After the inputs are entered, we are presented with a message that `index.html` has been written to.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would import `inquirer`, gather the required responses from the user and use those responses in conjunction with the `fs` module to write some html to a file. It will also require some creative string concatenation.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini-project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (60 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-project`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Mini-Project

  In this activity, you will build a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.

  ## Instructions

  * Your application should prompt the user for information like their name, location, bio, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub URL. Feel free to add any additional prompts you think of.

  * An HTML document containing the information collected from the prompts should be constructed and written to the file system. Be sure to add some CSS styling to the document.

  * You’ll need the following tools and technologies to accomplish this:

    * `fs` for writing to the file system

    * `inquirer` for collecting user input

    * String template literals for generating a string version of the HTML document before it is written to the file system

    * Promises for handling asynchronous behavior

  ## Hints

  It might be a good idea to start building out the HTML skeleton in a real HTML file. Once you're happy with the HTML file's appearance in the browser, you can copy and paste its contents into a string template literal. Then you can write a function to insert the user input into the appropriate places in the HTML string before writing it to the file system.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `inquirer.prompt()`

  * ✔️ `util.promisify()`

  * ✔️ Template literal syntax

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-project/Solved/Basic/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We can construct an HTML string using string template literals.

  * 🔑 We can use Promises or the async/await syntax to control the flow of asynchronous code.

  * 🔑 We can use the `fs.writeFile` method to create and write to the needed `index.html` file.

  * We import the required packages first, as follows:

    ```js
    const inquirer = require("inquirer");
    const fs = require("fs");
    const util = require("util");
    ```

  * 🔑  We use the `util.promisify` method to take a function that uses Node style callbacks to create a new version of the function that now uses Promises. As shown in the following example, it does exactly what it sounds like:

    ```js
    const writeFileAsync = util.promisify(fs.writeFile);
    ```

  * 🔑  `inquirer.prompt({})` will collect the needed responses from the user and assign them to an object for us. We called the object `answers`, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    function promptUser() {
      return inquirer.prompt([
        {
          type: "input",
          name: "name",
          message: "What is your name?"
        },
        {
          type: "input",
          name: "location",
          message: "Where are you from?"
        },
        {
          type: "input",
          name: "hobby",
          message: "What is your favorite hobby?"
        },
        {
          type: "input",
          name: "food",
          message: "What is your favorite food?"
        },
        {
          type: "input",
          name: "github",
          message: "Enter your GitHub Username"
        },
        {
          type: "input",
          name: "linkedin",
          message: "Enter your LinkedIn URL."
        }
      ]);
    }
    ```

  * You might be wondering what is the best way to actually make the HTML for this project? Here we use a helper function, `generateHTML` that will return a template string. We then inject the responses directly into that template string using the `${}` syntax, like in the following code:

    ```js
    function generateHTML(answers) {
      return `
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
      <meta charset="UTF-8">
      <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
      <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
      <div class="container">
        <h1 class="display-4">Hi! My name is ${answers.name}</h1>
        <p class="lead">I am from ${answers.location}.</p>
        <h3>Example heading <span class="badge badge-secondary">Contact Me</span></h3>
        <ul class="list-group">
          <li class="list-group-item">My GitHub username is ${answers.github}</li>
          <li class="list-group-item">LinkedIn: ${answers.linkedin}</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
    </body>
    </html>`;
    }
    ```

  * Finally, we call the `promptUser` function, and on success we generate the HTML file with these customized responses. We then create the file, appending the contents of the HTML template literal we created, like in the following example:

    ```js
    promptUser()
      .then(function(answers) {
        const html = generateHTML(answers);

        return writeFileAsync("index.html", html);
      })
      .then(function() {
        console.log("Successfully wrote to index.html");
      })
      .catch(function(err) {
        console.log(err);
      });
    ```

  * Let's take a quick look at the Bonus. Code using the `await` syntax must be inside of a function declared with the `async` identifier. We're also using a `try/catch` block to handle any errors that might occur when using async/await. You can see this in the following example:

      ```js
      async function init() {
      console.log("hi")
      try {
        const answers = await promptUser();

        const html = generateHTML(answers);

        await writeFileAsync("index.html", html);

        console.log("Successfully wrote to index.html");
      } catch(err) {
        console.log(err);
      }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can asynchronous code help developers write better code?

  * 🙋 Asynchronous programming allows the code to execute logic without blocking the rest of the application’s functionality.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Homework (5 min)

* Open `02-Homework/README.md` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Navigate to the `Master` folder and run `npm i`. 

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * We will build a command-line application that will generate readmes for us. 

  * You might actually want to use this application for all your homework in the future. It will also help keep each of your projects looking professional when you are applying for jobs.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning how to use `inquirer` to gather responses from the user, how to use `fs` to write the content to a markdown file, and also how to use the responses to inject data into the template strings.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 Much like the mini-project, we will be using the `inquirer` responses to write to a file.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 It will help us learn how to use Node's `fs` module. It also carries an added benefit of helping keep readme files looking fresh. Employers often view job seekers' pinned projects on GitHub, and a sleek readme can be the difference between piquing their interest or seeing them move on to the next candidate.

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Homework Requirements found in `02-Homework/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
