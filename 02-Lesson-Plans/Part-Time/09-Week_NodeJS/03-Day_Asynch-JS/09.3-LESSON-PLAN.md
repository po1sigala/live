# 09.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Advanced ES6

## Overview 

This lesson plan will cover some additional topics related to ES6 syntax. Some of the tools covered include the "for of" loop, rest operator, spread operator, and finally additional git concepts.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `21-Ins_For_of` through `28-Stu_Mini-project`

* This lesson covers some concepts that you may want to review in order to be prepared for student questions:
  * [MDN 'for...of' documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of).
  * [MDN 'spread' documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax).
  * [MDN 'destructuring assignment' documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment).

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought." Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify and implement how and when to use for of loops
* Identify and implement how and when to use the "spread" and "rest" operators
* Use destructuring assignment syntax to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into unique variables
* Identify and implement how and when to fork a git repository

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class and congratulate them on learning some of the most used ES6 syntax rules

* Reassure students that learning new syntax can be time consuming and difficult, but it won't always feel like that. Using these rules more will allow you to commit them to memory and use less mental bandwidth going forward.

* Explain that one of the best ways to learn these new rules is to try and use the newer syntax whenever possible. The old syntax is still perfectly valid, and if you have any doubts, it is always there to fall back on.

* These newer syntax rules are not born in a vacuum. They are the result of years of revision by a standards organization called ECMA. The ES in ES6 stands for ECMAScript. It is important to have standards in web development to ensure maximum compatibility across a wide spectrum of web browsers.

* ECMAScript itself is a programming language, but as far as we are concerned it is just a language from which our syntax rules are inherited. A more detailed history of ECMAScript can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).


### 2. Instructor Demo: for...of (5 min) 

* Open [21-Ins-For_Of](../../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/01-Activities/02-IntroToConsoleBash/README.md01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/21-Ins_For_Of/index.js) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` after commenting out the `.map` example. 

  * 🔑 Notice that when we run our code we see each value in our songs array.

    ```js
    const songs = ['Bad Guy', 'Old Town Road', '7 Rings'];

    for (const value of songs) {
        console.log(value);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 After we comment in the second example, we can also see that the we use a "for of" loop to iterate over an object or map

    ```js
    const songs = new Map([['Bad Guy', 1], ['Old Town Road', 2]]);

    for (const [key, value] of songs) {
        console.log(`${key}'s chart position is ${value}`);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Explain that the for...of statement creates a loop iterating over objects, including Array, Map, Set, String, TypedArray.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How does the "for ... of" seem to differ from a `forEach`?

  * 🙋 The `forEach` method only applies to arrays, while the "for ... of" is much more flexible.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [22-Stu_For_Of - Readme](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/22-Stu_For_Of/README.md).

### 3. Student Do: for...of (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [22-Stu_For_Of](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/22-Stu_For_Of/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
    ## For...of

    ### Instructions

    * Select all of the songs in `index.html` and store them in a variable using JavaScript.

    * Iterate through your collection with a for...of and:

    * Add a `class` that changes the color to red (you have to create this class in your CSS file)
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: for...of (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the "for ... of" loop? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ The syntax for the "for ... of" loop reads very similar to plain english which helps us conceptualize what is happening in our program.

  * ✔️ The syntax is relatively straightforward, the key takeaway is knowing when to use and and what to use it for.

* Open [index.html](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/22-Stu_For_Of/Solved/index.html) in your browser and explain the following: 

  * When we open the `index.html` file, we notice that each line item in our unordered list has green color
  
  * This is the result of using the `for ... of` loop to iterate over each line item and add the class of `green` to the class list for the given element. 

    ```js
        const songs = document.querySelectorAll("ul > li");

        for (const song of songs) {
            song.classList.add("green");
        }
    ```

  * 🔑 If you forget the syntax, VSCode can help you create these types of loops by offering a snippet to work from. You can try it yourself by typing `forof` and simply hitting enter.
    
    ```js
        for (const iterator of object) {
            
        }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do you know when to use a "for ... of" loop

  * 🙋 While it generally depends on the situation, "for ... of" loops help most when you need to iterate through key/value pairs in an object

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Rest and Spread Operators (5 min) 

* Open [Ins_Rest_and_Spread](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/23-Ins_Rest_and_Spread/index.js) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

#### Rest Parameters

  * 🔑 When we run the file we notice that we get output for a few different operations: without the rest operator, with the rest operator, without spread, and with spread.

    ```js
    function add(x, y) {
        return x + y;
    }

    console.log(add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) // => 3
    ```
  * Explain to the class that it is possible to call a function with any number of arguments, but only the first two will be counted.
  
  * Let's examine this function using the `rest` operator:

    ```js
    function add(...nums) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let num of nums) sum += num;
        return sum
    }

    add(1) // => 1
    add(3,3) // => 6
    add(1, 1, 4, 5) // => 11
    ```
  * In this example, we use a rest operator to collect all of the arguments into a `nums` array, giving us the ability to pass in as many arguments as we want.

  * Let's examine another example:

    ```js
    function howManyArgs(...args) {
        return `You passed ${args.length} arguments.`; // point out the template literal
    }

    console.log(howManyArgs(0, 1)); // You have passed 2 arguments.
    console.log(howManyArgs("argument!", null, ["one", 2, "three"], 4)); // You have passed 4 arguments.
    ```
  * 🔑  The takeaway here is that variables are now available inside the array of our function. We can also pass as many in as we want.

#### Spread Operator

  * 🔑  The spread operator allows iterables like arrays, objects and strings to be expanded into single arguments or elements. 
  
  * One way to think of this is like pouring out items from a cup. The only difference is that our items are variables and the cup is an iterable.

    ```js
    // Spread Operator

    let dragons = ['Drogon', 'Viserion', 'Rhaegal'];
    let weapons = ['dragonglass', ...dragons, 'wildfire']; // notice the spread operator ...dragons

    console.log(weapons); // prints ["dragonglass", "Drogon", "Viserion", "Rhaegal", "wildfire"]

    ```

  * Here you can see that we have expanded both arrays into a new array with all of the elements. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why does the first example of our `add` function only output `3`?

  * 🙋 This is due to the fact that only the first and second parameter get counted without the use of the rest operator
  
  * ☝️ The syntax for spread and rest are similar, but what is the difference between the two?

  * 🙋 The rest operator allows us to pass in any number of arguments while the spread operator allows us to spread out an iterable into unique variables.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [24-Stu_Rest_and_Spread - readme](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/24-Stu_Rest_and_Spread/README.MD).

### 6. Student Do: Rest and Spread Operators (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [24-Stu_Rest_and_Spread - readme](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/24-Stu_Rest_and_Spread/README.MD).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
## Spread and Rest

**Follow the comments in `index.js`.

1. Copy the `songs` array into another array using spread and console.log what it returns.

2.  Modify the `addition` function so that is uses the rest operator and maintains the same functionality. You should still be able to pass in any number of arguments. Run the code first in your console to see the functionality.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: Spread and Rest Operators (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with spread and rest operators? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ The spread and rest operators might look very similar to you at this point, so don't be intimidated if you get them confused at first. We will have plenty of examples to help solidify your understanding moving forward.

  * ✔️ During this exercise we also used something called `reduce` which is used in our case to calculate the sum of an array. Lets look at the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) briefly before we review.

* Open [Solved/index.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/24-Stu_Rest_and_Spread/Solved/index.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * The first example we are using the spread operator copy the items in `songs` to `new_songs`. Much like we would be dumping out the contents of a cup, we are populating the `new_songs` array with the items in `songs`.

    ```js
    const songs = ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
    const new_songs = [...songs];

    console.log(new_songs); // => ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
    ```

* In the next example we modify our addition function to make use of the rest operator. This allows us to pass in as many arguments as we need. This is particularly useful in this case where we want to add as many numbers as necessary.

    ```js

    // unsolved version
    function addition(x, y, z) {
        const array = [x, y, z];
        return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    }
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6

    // solved using rest
    function addition(...array) {
        return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); // you don't have to change this line of code but look up reduce if you're not sure what it does here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
    }
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)); // 110
    ```

  * 🔑  There is a good chance that you may be confused on where spread and operators go, since they are very similar and can be used in similar situations. This is just an introduction and they will begin to pick up fluency as they get more practice.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.
