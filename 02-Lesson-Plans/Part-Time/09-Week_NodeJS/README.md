# Unit 09: NodeJS

## Overview

In this unit, we'll introduce students to Node.js and the concepts of standard library, modules, npm, and package.json.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* The transition from client-side development to Node.js can be challenging for students. This lesson plan is a gentle introduction to the fundamentals.

* If students continually question why they are learning Node.js, emphasize the client-server model.

* Ensure that students have already installed Node.js on their [Mac](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-mac.md) or [Windows](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-win.md) computers before coming to class.

## Career Connection
Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connections folder](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/CAREER-CONNECTION.md).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

* Next week, we begin OOP, constructors, and classes. Try to spend some time this week to ensure that students get comfortable with ES6 and other Node.js fundamentals so that it's not distracting when we move into more abstract concepts.
