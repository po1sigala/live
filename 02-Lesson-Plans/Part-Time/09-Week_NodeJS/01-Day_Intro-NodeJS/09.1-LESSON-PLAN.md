# 09.1 Lesson Plan: Introduction to Node.js (6:30 PM)

## Overview 

This lesson introduces Node.js and the concepts of standard library, modules, npm, and package.json. It also introduces the concepts of newer ES6 syntax. Students will build an interactive command line application that outputs `.json` files using `fs` and `Inquirer`.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Node-Demo` through `10-Stu_TemplateLiterals`

* Students will be expected to have Node installed, but if they don't, be sure to empower them to know that they can install it using the resources found in `04-Important`. Installation steps are available for [Mac](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-mac.md) and [Windows](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-win.md).

    * A helpful link to direct students to is https://nodejs.org/en/
    * Remind students that they will want the LTS (long term support) version.
    * `node -v` in the terminal will output a version number if installed correctly.

* Transitioning from client-side to backend development can be a little confusing at first. This is a good opportunity to remind students that Node is Chrome's V8 engine running on your machine rather than in the browser. This gives us the ability to have access to things like the filesystem.

* Students may ask why they are learning Node.JS. This is a great opportunity to explain that this allows to create our own APIs and build our own applications using the client-server model.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the client-server model
* Run simple very simple javascript files from the command line using Node
* Understand arrow functions and how they impact the `this` context
* Use template strings, also how to use `const` and `let` in place of `var`
* Use functional loops like `.map` and `.filter`

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hXNcmzYqwlhgM-C78vNFKwX10PhW_iwIo0guwzHO48c/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Introduction to Node.js (Title)**: Today's class is a miletsone as we make the transition from writing client-side code to server-side code using Node.js. 

  * **What is Full Stack Web Development?**: What does it mean to be a full stack web developer?  
  
  * **Full Stack Web Development**: Full stack web development is understanding the suite of tools required to build both the front _and_ back ends of a web application. 

  * **How much of the stack do we know?**: What have we learned up to this point? 
  
  * **Client-side**: The three primary components of client-side code are HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

  * **What is a client?**: Where do HTML, CSS and JavaScript come together?

  * **Definition of Web Client**: A client is both computer hardware and software that makes requests to a server. 

  * **What is GitHub Pages doing?**: What happens when we _deploy_ our projects to GitHub Pages?'

  * **Awesome Project Deployed to GitHub Pages**: GitHub Pages is _serving_ content to clients.

  * **What is a server?**: What does it mean to "server" content? 

  * **Server Definition**: Depending on the context, a server is both the physical hardware _and_ software that hears requests from users and returns something, such as an HTML or image file, or completes a process. 

  * **What is the Client-Server Model?**: How do clients and servers interact?

  * **The Client-Server Model**: In modern web applications, there is constant back-and-forth communication between the visuals displayed on the user‚Äôs browser (the front-end) and the data and logic stored on the server (the back-end). Clients make requests, servers respond.

  * **What is Node.js?**: How do we program a server?

  * **Node.js**: Node allows us to run JavaScript _outside_ the browser as well as on a server. Since Node is purely JavaScript, a front-end JavaScript developer can also work on server side code without having to learn a new programming language.


### 2. Instructor Demo: Node Demo (5 mins) 

* Open [01-Ins_Node-Demo](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/01-Ins_Node-Demo/index.js) in your terminal and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë  When we run the index.js file, we notice that the value of `this` has changed significantly


  * üîë  When we examine the output of the console log, we notice some recognizable methods that are available in Node

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it necessary to wrap the `console.log` in an invoked function

  * üôã Simply console logging the `this` keyword will return an empty object. This is because context only makes sense inside of functions. Without one, we won't have anything to return

### 3. Student Do: Node Demo (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [01-Ins_Node-Demo](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/01-Ins_Node-Demo/index.js).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
  # "This"and Node.js

  In this activity, you will write and run your first Node.js application and examine the return value of `this`.

  ## Instructions

  * Open, `index.js`, in your working directory.

  * Write a JavaScript function that will log the value of `this`

  * Then run the program using Node from the command line.

  * Confirm that it logged the text as you would expect.

  ## Hint(s)

  * If you see an empty object, try wrapping the `console.log` in an function.

  ## Bonus

  * What happens when you log `window`?
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Node Demo (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the `this` keyword in Node? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * When we examine the output of the console log, we notice some recognizable methods that are available in Node: `setInterval`, `setTimeout`

  * In the browser, the `this` context refers to the `Window` object by default
  
  * In Node, `this` refers to the outermost global object

* Open [01-Ins_Node-Demo](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/01-Ins_Node-Demo/index.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * When we run our finished Javascript we should have something like this:

  ```
    (function () {
      console.log(this);
    })();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it necessary to wrap the `console.log(this)` in a function?

  * üôã Simply console logging the `this` keyword will return an empty object. This is because context only makes sense inside of functions. Without one, we won't have anything to return

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Node docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

  * üîë @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * üîë @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }
