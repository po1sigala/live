# 09.1 Lesson Plan: Introduction to Node.js (6:30 PM)

## Overview 

This lesson introduces Node.js and the concepts of standard library, modules, npm, and package.json. It also introduces the concepts of newer ES6 syntax. Students will build an interactive command line application that outputs `.json` files using `fs` and `Inquirer`.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Node-Demo` through `10-Stu_TemplateLiterals`

* Students will be expected to have Node installed, but if they don't, be sure to empower them to know that they can install it using the resources found in `04-Important`. Installation steps are available for [Mac](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-mac.md) and [Windows](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-win.md).

    * A helpful link to direct students to is https://nodejs.org/en/
    * Remind students that they will want the LTS (long term support) version.
    * `node -v` in the terminal will output a version number if installed correctly.

* Transitioning from client-side to backend development can be a little confusing at first. This is a good opportunity to remind students that Node is Chrome's V8 engine running on your machine rather than in the browser. This gives us the ability to have access to things like the filesystem.

* Students may ask why they are learning Node.JS. This is a great opportunity to explain that this allows to create our own APIs and build our own applications using the client-server model.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the client-server model
* Run simple very simple javascript files from the command line using Node
* Understand arrow functions and how they impact the `this` context
* Use template strings, also how to use `const` and `let` in place of `var`
* Use functional loops like `.map` and `.filter`

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hXNcmzYqwlhgM-C78vNFKwX10PhW_iwIo0guwzHO48c/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Introduction to Node.js (Title)**: Today's class is a miletsone as we make the transition from writing client-side code to server-side code using Node.js. 

  * **What is Full Stack Web Development?**: What does it mean to be a full stack web developer?  
  
  * **Full Stack Web Development**: Full stack web development is understanding the suite of tools required to build both the front _and_ back ends of a web application. 

  * **How much of the stack do we know?**: What have we learned up to this point? 
  
  * **Client-side**: The three primary components of client-side code are HTML, CSS & JavaScript. 

  * **What is a client?**: Where do HTML, CSS and JavaScript come together?

  * **Definition of Web Client**: A client is both computer hardware and software that makes requests to a server. 

  * **What is GitHub Pages doing?**: What happens when we _deploy_ our projects to GitHub Pages?'

  * **Awesome Project Deployed to GitHub Pages**: GitHub Pages is _serving_ content to clients.

  * **What is a server?**: What does it mean to "server" content? 

  * **Server Definition**: Depending on the context, a server is both the physical hardware _and_ software that hears requests from users and returns something, such as an HTML or image file, or completes a process. 

  * **What is the Client-Server Model?**: How do clients and servers interact?

  * **The Client-Server Model**: In modern web applications, there is constant back-and-forth communication between the visuals displayed on the user‚Äôs browser (the front-end) and the data and logic stored on the server (the back-end). Clients make requests, servers respond.

  * **What is Node.js?**: How do we program a server?

  * **Node.js**: Node allows us to run JavaScript _outside_ the browser as well as on a server. Since Node is purely JavaScript, a front-end JavaScript developer can also work on server side code without having to learn a new programming language.


### 2. Instructor Demo: Node Demo (5 mins) 

* Open [01-Ins_Node-Demo](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/01-Ins_Node-Demo/index.js) in your terminal and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë  When we run the index.js file, we notice that the value of `this` has changed significantly

  * üîë  When we examine the output of the console log, we notice some recognizable methods that are available in Node

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it necessary to wrap the `console.log` in an invoked function

  * üôã Simply console logging the `this` keyword will return an empty object. This is because context only makes sense inside of functions. Without one, we won't have anything to return

### 3. Student Do: Node Demo (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [02-Stu-Hello-Demo](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/02-Stu_Hello-Node/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
  # Hello Node.js

In this activity, you will write and run your first Node.js application.

## Instructions

* Create a file, `index.js`, in your working directory.

* Write JavaScript to log the string, "Hellooo, Node!".

* Then run the program using Node from the command line.

* Confirm that it logged the text as you would expect.

## Hint(s)

* It's just JavaScript.

## Bonus

* What happens when you log `window`? What happens when you try to use `prompt`, `alert`, or `confirm`?

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Node Demo (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the `this` keyword in Node as well as `console.log`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * When we examine the output of the console log, we notice some recognizable methods that are available in Node: `setInterval`, `setTimeout`

  * Only in the browser does, the `this` context refers to the `Window` object by default
  
  * In Node, `this` refers to the outermost global object

* Open [01-Ins_Node-Demo](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/01-Ins_Node-Demo/index.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * When we run our finished Javascript we should have something like this:

  ```
    (function () {
      console.log(this);
    })();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it necessary to wrap the `console.log(this)` in a function?

  * üôã Simply console logging the `this` keyword will return an empty object. This is because context only makes sense inside of functions. Without one, we won't have anything to return

  * What happens when we log `window` to the console?

  * üôã We get an error, `window` is not defined in node.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What kinds of things do we think are possible in the browser, but not possible in node?

  * üôã We can't use prompts, confirms or alerts because of the of the Window object

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Node docs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 5. Instructor Demo: Arrow functions (5 mins) 

* Open [03-Ins_ArrowFunction/01-syntax](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/03-Ins_ArrowFunction/01-syntax.js) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* In this demonstration you will give students and overview of arrow functions, including syntax differences, when to use them, and when to avoid them.

* Explain to the class that ES6 introduces a newer shorter syntax for writing functions. Consider the following example found in [01-syntax.js](/Users/johnmccambridge/coding/fullstack-ground/01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/03-Ins_ArrowFunction/01-syntax.js).

* üîë Walk the students through each function below. See if they can point out the differences in syntax.

  ```js
  // ES5 function
  var createGreeting = function(message, name) {
    return message + ", " + name + "!";
  };

  // ES6 arrow function
  var createGreeting = (message, name) => {
    return message + ", " + name + "!";
  };

  ```

* Answer any questions about arrow functions before moving on to some differences between arrow functions and regular functions.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the code found in [02-context](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/03-Ins_ArrowFunction/02-context.js)

  ```js
  // Depending on the environment `setTimeout` is called in, it may refer to one of two objects
  // In the browser, `setTimeout` is a property of the `window` object
  // In node, it belongs to a special "Timeout" object

  var person = {
    name: "Hodor",
    saySomething: function() {
      console.log(this.name + " is thinking...");
      setTimeout(function() {
        console.log(this.name + "!");
      }, 100);
    }
  };

  person.saySomething(); // prints "Hodor is thinking..."
  // prints "undefined!" 100ms later
  ```

  * Students may still not feel completely comfortable with the `this` keyword in JavaScript yet, inform them that many experienced developers still aren't as it's a tricky topic.

  * Point out how this code works as intended. Explain that this is because an arrow function automatically binds to the context or object it's created inside of, even if it is not a direct property of that object. The arrow function is created when `saySomething` is run, inside of `person` right before the `setTimeout` is run.

  * In preparation for the discussion, ask TAs to start directing students to the code found in [03-property-methods](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/03-Ins_ArrowFunction/03-property-methods.js)

  ```js
  // Avoid using arrow functions for object methods
  var dog = {
    name: "Lassie",
    sound: "Woof!",
    makeSound: () => console.log(this.sound),
    readTag: () => console.log("The dog's tag reads: " + this.name + ".")
  };

  // Prints `undefined`
  dog.makeSound();

  // Prints `The dog's tag reads: undefined.`
  dog.readTag();

  // In the makeSound and readTag methods, `this` doesn't refer to `dog`
  // If this code run in node, `this` refers to `module.exports` (the object containing all the exports in this file)
  // If this code was run in the browser, `this` would refer to the window
  ```

  * Explain that when working with objects, we typically want to avoid using arrow functions for its methods. In these cases, the arrow function will bind to the context it's created inside of (probably the `window` or `module.exports` object).

  * We can replace regular functions most of the time, except when it comes to using the this keyword.
  
  * Students will become more comfortable with when to use and not use arrow functions as they practice using them. For now, they should understand that they can use them most of the time, but they should avoid using them as object methods.

  * Take a moment to answer any lingering questions.


### 6. Student Do: Arrow Function Practice (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [04-property-methods](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/04-Stu_ArrowFunctionPractice/README.md)

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Arrow Function Practice

In this activity we will convert a file with pre-written code over to use arrow functions where suitable.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/index.js](Unsolved/index.js) in your editor and run the code. Take a few moments to study the values logged to the console, but don't worry about understanding every part of the code. For this activity you only need to remember the rules established about when arrow functions should and shouldn't be used.

* Update this example to use arrow functions **where suitable**. If successful, the code should still work the exact same way.

## Hints

* Remember the case from the last example in which we should _not_ be using arrow functions.

## Bonus

* After you've converted all of the functions to arrow functions where possible, look for opportunities to shorten the arrow function syntax even further by removing parentheses and curly braces where allowed.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Arrow function practice: { ACTIVITY NAME } (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with Arrow Functions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Open [04-Stu-ArrowFunctionPractice](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/01-Activities/04-Stu_ArrowFunctionPractice/Solved/index.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * Even though we have converted a few examples over to use arrow functions, the code works exactly as it did before

  ```js
  var funnyCase = string => {
    var newString = "";
    for (var i = 0; i < string.length; i++) {
      if (i % 2 === 0) newString += string[i].toLowerCase();
      else newString += string[i].toUpperCase();
    }
    return newString;
  };
  ```

  * üîë  We can omit parenthesis around arrow functions if there is only one parameter.
    * NOTE: This does not work if the arrow function has multiple parameters
    * Please remind students that all of this is optional. The old syntax is not only valid, but accepted.
  
  ```js
  var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

  var doubled = map(numbers, element => element * 2);
  ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why didn't we convert the functions in the `netflixQueue` object to arrow functions

  ```js
    watchMovie: function() {
      this.queue.pop();
    },
  ```

  * üôã Whenever working with objects and creating methods, we don't want to use arrow functions because the `this` context will change, and therefore break our implementation.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
