# 15.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Project 2

## Overview

Today's class will be focused on introducing students to project 2 requirements.

## Instructor Notes

* Today's class will be focused on introducing students to the requirements for project 2.

* Students will begin work on their second project.

* Leverage the TAs to help any groups lagging behind during the lesson. We want to give students as much time to brainstorm project ideas as possible.

## Learning Objectives

* Students will submit a project proposal (ideas, outlines, APIs) by end of class for feedback.

* Project groups will create a project repo set up with linting and add members as collaborators.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (5 min) 

* Welcome students to class. Praise students for making it to their second group projects.

* Assure the class that they'll have plenty of time to brainstorm project ideas before submitting their proposals for review by the end of class.

### 2. Instructor Do: Project 2 Slides (10 min)

* Go through the [Unit 15: Project 2](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_Ap23wFlGvGS4HfMVgBWPNlFo8IkHV0bTO6QvYs9XT0/edit?usp=sharing) slide deck.

* Slack out the [requirements for project 2](../../../../01-Class-Content/15-Project-2/02-Homework/README.md).

* Let students know that they can use their code from the previous unit to set up authentication for their project.

* Answer any questions about project requirements.

### 3. Student Do: Create a Repository (15 mins)

* Have students sit with their project groups as they create a new project repository. Then have them invite each other as collaborators.

* One group member should create a new Github repo for the project.

* Protect the repo's main branch as we did during project 1.

  * Once at the repo's page, click the "Settings" tab.

  * Select "Branches" from the left sidebar.

  * Under "Branch protection rules", choose "main" from the dropdown.

  * Check off the following options:

    * "Protect this branch"

    * "Require pull request reviews before merging"

    * "Include administrators"

    * "Require branches to be up to date before merging"
  
  * Click "Save changes"

* Once complete, invite the other group members as collaborators.

### 4. Student Do: Break into Teams (60 mins)

* Direct students to begin to work with their groups to identify ideas, research APIs, and create project designs. 

* At your discretion, feel free to utilize TAs and host "workshops" to help steer groups in the right direction. 

  * Many of you may only have a rough idea of what your project will consist of. This is a good opportunity to rule out ideas and get a good sense of what is feasible. 

  * Be cautious of underestimating the amount of time that features will take to implement. Try thinking of the MVP for each idea and attempt to pick the idea that excites your group and seems feasible in the time you have.

### 5. BREAK (15 mins)

### 6. Groups Do: Project Brainstorming (75 mins)

* Students begin work with groups to identify ideas, research APIs, and create project designs.

* Students should expect to submit initial project idea proposals by the end of class today.

### 7. END (0 min)
