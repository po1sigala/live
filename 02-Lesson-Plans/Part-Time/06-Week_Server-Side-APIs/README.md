# Unit 06 Instructor Overview: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In this unit, you will teach students how to use the `fetch()` method to make requests to the GitHub API and convert the returned data into HTML elements. You will also discuss the client-server model and leverage the Chrome DevTools Network tab to verify response statuses.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* The MDN Web Docs use ES6 in their Fetch API examples, but our activities will continue to use ES5 syntax, because that is what students will be familiar with. We will cover ES6 syntax in Unit 09, so until then, our activities will continue to use ES5 syntax.

* Along with the Fetch API, students will also briefly experiment with cURL, `XMLHttpRequest` objects, and `$.ajax()`.

* Students will use the GitHub API for activities and the OpenWeather API for their homework. The OpenWeather API requires signing up for a key.

* Remind students to complete this unit's assessment near the end of the week. Students can find it in the Unit Overview under Technical Interview Preparation.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career-Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

For the next two units, students will work on their first group project. Groups should consist of three to four students each. Don't let students work on a project alone, as this is their only chance to truly learn Git collaboration.
