# 12.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to MySQL 

## Overview 

This lesson introduces MySQL Shell and executing CRUD functions using SQL commands. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_MySQL-Shell` through `10-Stu_CRUD-DELETE`.

* Prior to class, please make sure that you have [installed MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-installation-excerpt/5.7/en/) on your machine and be prepared to troubleshoot any issues students may have faced during setup. 

* Today's activities, use MySQL Shell. Please make sure you have your MySQL password ready for use to demonstrate the activities. 

* After starting the MySQL server, make sure that students can initialize the MySQL command-line prompt, using the command `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password.

  * If macOS users get the error message `command not found`, they might need to add the following into their `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:
 
    `export PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/"`

  * If Windows users get the `command not found` error, refer them to the [MySQL documentation on customizing the PATH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-windows-excerpt/5.7/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html).

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use the MySQL Shell to execute commands

* Create and delete a database

* Create a table to store data

* Perform CRUD functions using MySQL commands.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1In4Iv-dAv3A3BiU88duttuXpEPcvbr4Qf4RniD8EZsE/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **What is SQL?**: SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a query language that allows us to interact with a database.

  * **How Does SQL Interact With a Database?**: SQL uses a query, or a structured inquiry, to react with data that is stored in a  database. A SQL query can be used to create, read, update, and delete data.
  
  * **What is a Relational Database?**: A relational database organizes data into tables. A table holds a group of data and is divided into rows and columns. The tables can be linked to form relationships.

  * **How Do We Link Tables?**: Tables can be linked based on data that is common to both of them. Keys identify rows of data in a table. By matching keys between two tables, a relationship is formed.

  * **What is a Query?**: A SQL query interacts with data in a database using the names of tables columns and relationships between tables. Using a query, we can supply data to our front-end to build sites capable of interacting with lots of data quickly and easily.

  * **Why Learn SQL?**: SQL is a marketable skill that's used in a majority of databases in every economic sector, from manufacturing, logistics, and health care to insurance, commerce, and much more. SQL also makes it easy to handle large amounts of data and scale up quickly. 

* Navigate to `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in your command line and run `npm install` and `node server.js`.

* Open `localhost:3001/api/movies` demonstrate the following:

  * We use SQL queries to write and retrieve data from our database. 

  * This SQL query returns the `id` and `title` from each row in the movies database.

  * The data is returned as an object that we can then manipulate and use to populate our page. 

  * Using a SQL query, we can return even large sets of data quickly.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning to use SQL, or Structured Query Language, to access a database. 

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will use an Express server to send our SQL queries and access the database. 

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 SQL is used in many industries and is a highly sought after skill for developers. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: MySQL Shell (5 min) 

* Open the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 To start, we navigate to the root directory of our project and then type the following command into the terminal to confirm that the MySQL server is up and running.

    ```sh
    mysql --version
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, in the terminal, at the root directory of the project, enter the following command. When prompted, we enter our MySQL password.

    ```sh
    mysql -uroot -p
    ```

  * 🔑 We write our commands after the `mysql` prompt. Don't forget, all commands must end with a semi-colon!

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE demo_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also write our commands in a `sql` file and execute the file in the MySQL shell using `SOURCE`.

    ```sql
    source schema.sql
    ```

  * 🔑 To exit the MySQL Shell, we type `quit`.

    ```sql
    quit
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are two ways we can execute commands using the MySQL Shell?

  * 🙋 We can enter the command after the `mysql` prompt or we can write our command in a `sql` file and then execute the the file using `SOURCE`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_MySQL-Shell/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: MySQL Shell (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_MySQL-Shell/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📖 Execute a SQL File Using MySQL Shell

  ## 💡 Hints

  * What commands do you use to start MySQL in the command line? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What kind of database is MySQL?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: MySQL Shell (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with MySQL Shell? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `schema.sql`

  * ✔️ `SOURCE`

* Navigate to `02-Stu_MySQL-Shell/Solved` in your command line and explain the following: 

  * To open the MySQL Shell, we execute `mysql -uroot -p` into the command line and then enter our MySQL password.

    ```sh
    mysql -uroot -p
    ```

  * 🔑 We then use the `SOURCE` command to execute our schema from the `schema.sql` shell. Don't forget the semi-colon! 

    ```sh
    SOURCE db/schema.sql;
    ```

  * 🔑 To make sure our database has been created, we use the `SHOW` command to see the existing databases.

    ```sh
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

  * To exit the MySQL shell, we enter the command `quit`.

    ```sh
    quit
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we execute a schema file in MySQL Shell? 

  * 🙋 To execute a `schema.sql` command in our MySQL Shell, we use the `SOURCE` command. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL Docs on Getting Started with MySQL Shell](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-shell/8.0/en/mysql-shell-getting-started.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Databases (5 min) 

* Open `03-Ins_Databases` in your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use a database to store and organize data we will access with MySQL. 

  * 🔑 To create a new database, we navigate to the command line and enter `mysql -uroot -p` to open MySQL Shell.

    ```sh
    mysql -uroot -p
    ```

  * 🔑 Then, we use the `CREATE DATABASE` command and add of the database we want to create.

      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
      ```

  * 🔑 The `CREATE` command is all we need to create a database. But it is a good idea to check if the database has already been created, and if so drop it. We do this before we create the database. 
  
      ```sql
      DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS employees_db;
      CREATE DATABASE employees_db;
      ```

  * 🔑 Once a database is created, we then enter `USE` to select our database for use. 

      ```sql
      USE inventory_db;
      ```

  * 🔑 To check which database is currently in use, we use `SELECT DATABASE()`.

      ```sql
      SELECT DATABASE();
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we create and select a database using MySQL?

  * 🙋 We use the `CREATE` command to create a database and the `USE` command to select a database for use. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Databases/README.md`.

  * 🔑 To drop the `sample_db` database, we use the `DROP` command.

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sample_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 To create a new `books_db`, we start by checking if a database of the same name already exists, and, if so, drop it. 

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we add a new `books_db` using the `CREATE` command.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What command do we use to delete a database? 

  * 🙋 We use the `DROP DATABASE` command. To prevent an error from occurring if the database does not exist, we add 'IF EXISTS`. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL Docs on Create Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-database.html), [MySQL Docs on Drop Database](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/drop-database.html),and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Tables (5 min) 

* Open `05-Ins_Tables/db/schema.sql` in your IDE and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 To add data to databases, we use tables. 

  * 🔑 We start by creating a database to hold our tables.

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS inventory_db;
    CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 To add tables, we then must select the database for use. 

    ```sql
    USE inventory_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 To create a new table, we use the `CREATE TABLE` command followed by the name of our new table.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE produce;
    ```

  * 🔑 We then add the names of the columns that will hold our data in parentheses `()` and describe the type of data the column will hold. We use `INT` to designate an integer and `VARCHAR(100) to hold a string up to 100 characters. 

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE produce (
      id INT,
      name VARCHAR(100)
    );
    ```

* Navigate to `05-Ins_Tables` in your command line and enter `mysql -uroot -p` to open the MySQL Shell.

  * We execute our schema file using the `SOURCE` command.

    ```sql
    SOURCE db/schema.sql;
    ```

  * To check that our table has been successfully added, we use the `SHOW` command to list the tables in our database. 

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we add data to our database?

  * 🙋 We create a table to hold our data. Tables are made up of columns which hold a type of data like an integer or string. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `CREATE TABLE`

  * ✔️ `SHOW TABLES`

* Open `06-Stu_Tables/Solved/db/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * Tables store data in databases. To start, we create a database to hold our new table. 

    ```sql

    USE books_db;
    ```

  * 🔑 Next, we use the `CREATE` command and give our table a name. 

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE biographies;
    ```

  * Tables are made up of columns that hold a certain data type. We add two columns `int` and `name` and add their data types.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE biographies (
      id INT,
      name VARCHAR(100)
    );
    ```

* Navigate to `06-Stu_Tables/Solved` in your command line and enter `mysql -uroot -p` to open the MySQL Shell.

  * We execute our file using `SOURCE`.

    SOURCE db/schema.sql;
    ```

  * We check that the database was created using `SHOW DATABASES;`

    ```sql
    SHOW DATABASES;
    ```

  * 🔑 We check that our new table is part of our database using `SHOW TABLES;`.

    ```sql
    SHOW TABLES;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we create a table to store data inside a database? 

  * 🙋 We select the database using the `USE` command. Then, we use the `CREATE TABLE` command to create a table. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL Docs on Creating Tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-tables.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: CRUD-Insert (5 min) 

* Open `07-Ins-CRUD-Insert/db/insert-one.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Data is stored in rows in a MySQL table. To add a row to an existing table, we use the `INSERT INTO` command followed by the name of the table where we want to add data.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO produce
    ```

  * The data inserted must fit into our existing columns. So, we specify the column names where we want to add data.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO produce (id, name) 
    ```

  * We then add data for the row making sure the data added matches our assigned data type using `VALUES`.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO produce (id, name)
      VALUES (1, "apple");
    ```

* Open `07-Ins-CRUD-Insert/db/insert-many.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We can also add data to multiple rows at the same time, making sure we separate each row of data with a comma `,`.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO produce (id, name)
      VALUES
       ( 1, "apple"),
       ( 2, "orange"),
       ( 3, "banana");
    ```

* Navigate to `06-Stu_Tables/Solved` in your command line and enter `mysql -uroot -p` to open the MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the `schema.sql` file in the MySQL Shell to create our database and table. 

    ```sql
    SOURCE db/schema.sql;
    ```

  * We use `SELECT DATABASE()` to make sure our database is now in use and our table has been added. This is the table we will use to add our data.

    ```sql
    SELECT DATABASE();
    ```

  * We execute the `insert-many.sql` file in the Shell to add multiple rows of data. 

    ```sql
    SOURCE db/insert-many.sql;
    ```

  * Now that we have data stored in our table, we can access and manipulate it with a query. We use the `SELECT` command to `SELECT` data and an asterisk `*` to select all the data in each row.

    ```sql
    SELECT * from produce;
    ```
  * The data from each row is returned in the command line. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we add data to a table?

  * 🙋 We use the `INSERT INTO` command.

  * ☝️ How do write a query to select all the data in a table?

  * 🙋 We use the `SELECT` command. To select all, we can use an asterisk. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_CRUD-Insert/README.md`.

  * ✔️ `INSERT INTO`

  * ✔️ `VALUES`

  * ✔️ `SELECT *`

* Open `08-Ins-CRUD-Insert/db/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We check if a database named `books_db` already exists, and if so, drop it. 

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    ```

  * We create a new database using `CREATE DATABASE`.

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;
    ```

  * We select our new database with `USE`.

    ```sql
    USE books_db;
    ```

  * We create a new table `biographies` with two columns: `id` and `name`. Each column is assigned a data type that determines the kind of information it will hold. 

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE biographies (
      id INT NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

* Open `08-Ins-CRUD-Insert/db/insert-select.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 Now, that we have a database and a table to hold our data, we are ready to insert data. We use the `INSERT INTO` command to select the table and the columns where we want to add data.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO biographies (id, name)
    ```

  * 🔑 Next we use `VALUES` to add values. 

    ```sql
    VALUES
      ( 001, "Diary of Anne Frank"),
      ( 002, "Frida: A Biography of Frida Kahlo"),
      ( 003, "Long Walk to Freedom");
    ```

   * To query our database and select all the data from our new table, we use `SELECT *

     ```sql
     SELECT * from biographies;
     ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we insert data into a table? 

  * 🙋 We first have to select the database where the table is located for use. Then, we use the `INSERT INTO` command to select the table and columns where we want data added. Finally, we use the `VALUES` command to add new rows of data. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL Docs on Insert](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/insert.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: CRUD-Delete (5 min) 

* Open `09-Ins-CRUD-Delete/db/delete.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We can delete a row in a table using the `DELETE FROM` command to select a table.

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM produce
    ```

  * 🔑 We do not want to delete all the rows. We only want to delete a specific row. The `WHERE` clause allows us to specify a condition to meet. In this case, we want to delete a row where the `id` equals `2`.

    ```sql 
    WHERE id = 2;
    ```
  
* Open `09-Ins-CRUD-Delete/db/update.sql` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We can also use the `UPDATE` command to change the data. To start, we select the table we want to update.

    ```sql
    UPDATE produce
    ```

  * 🔑 Then, we use `SET` to assign the new data to a column.

    ```sql
    SET name = "strawberry"
    ```

  * 🔑 We only want the `name` column to have the value of `strawberry` in the row with the `id` of `1`, so we add a `WHERE` clause.

    ```sql
    WHERE id = 1;
    ```

* Navigate to `09-Ins_CRUD-Delete` in your command line and enter `mysql -uroot -p` to open the MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the `schema.sql` file in the MySQL Shell to create our database and table. 

    ```sql
    SOURCE db/schema.sql;
    ```

  * We use `SELECT *` to see the contents of our `produce` table.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM produce;
    ```

  * We execute the `delete.sql` file to run the delete query.

   ```sql
   SOURCE db/schema.sql;
   ```

  * When we run a `SELECT` query to once again see the contents of our `produce` table, the row has been deleted.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM produce;
    ```

  * We execute the `insert.sql` file to run the insert query.

   ```sql
   SOURCE db/schema.sql;
   ```

  * When we run a `SELECT` query to once again see the contents of our `produce` table, the data for row `2` has changed..

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM produce;
    ```
   
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What clause do we use to specify a condition? 

  * 🙋 We use the `WHERE` clause to specify a condition. For example if we set the condition to be `id` equals `2`, then only the row with the `id` of 2 will be deleted or updated. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/README.md`.

### 16. Student Do: CRUD Delete (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  # 🐛 Data Not Updating in Database

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

  * As a user, I want to update a single row of data in a table using a MySQL statement.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When I execute a MySQL statement, I want only the data with `id` of `2` to update to `Candide`.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When I execute a MySQL statement to update the data, the data in all the rows display to the new value. 

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. Create `books_db` database and select it for use.

  2. Execute the `insert.sql` file in the command line to insert data.

  3. Execute the `update.sql` file to update table.

  4. Enter the query `SELECT * FROM fiction` to view contents of table. 

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ## 💡 Hints

  What clause do we use to filter and select specific rows to be updated? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How do we distinguish SQL syntax from other text?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: CRUD Delete (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with deleting and updating data? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `UPDATE`

  * ✔️ `SET`

  * ✔️ `WHERE`

* Open `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/Solved/db/schema.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We create a `books_db` database and select it for use.

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS books_db;
    CREATE DATABASE books_db;
    USE books_db;
    ```

  * We create a table named `fiction` to hold our data. The table has an `id` and `name` column.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE fiction (
      id INT NOT NULL,
      name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    );
    ```

* Open `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/Solved/db/insert.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We use `INSERT INTO` to add data.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO fiction (id, name)
      VALUES
       ( 001, "To Kill a Mockingbird"),
       ( 002, "100 Years of Solitude"),
       ( 003, "War and Peace");
    ```
* Open `10-Stu_CRUD-Delete/Solved/db/update.sql` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * Now that we have data in our table, we use the `UPDATE` command to update the data in our `fiction` table.

    ```sql
    UPDATE fiction
    ```

  * Then, we use `SET` to determine the column where the data will be updated. 

    ```sql
    SET name = "Candide"
    ```

  * Next, we add a condition to determine which rows will be changed. If we don't set a condition all the rows will be changed. 

    ```sql
    WHERE id = 2;
    ```

* Navigate to `10-Ins_CRUD-Delete/Solved` in your command line and enter `mysql -uroot -p` to open the MySQL Shell.

  * We execute the `schema.sql` file in the MySQL Shell to create our database and table. 

    ```sql
    SOURCE db/schema.sql;
    ```

  * We use `SELECT *` to see the contents of our `fiction` table. Now, that we specified a condition using a `WHERE` clause, only the second row has changed.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM fiction;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What CRUD operations can we do with a SQL query? 

  * 🙋 We can create data using `INSERT`, we can read data using `SELECT`, we can update data using `UPDATE` and delete data using `DELETE`. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MySQL Docs on Common Queries](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/examples.html), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
