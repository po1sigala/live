# Unit 12 Instructor Overview: SQL 

## Overview

During this week, youâ€™ll introduce students to the final layer to your tech stack: the database. Students will learn to design a MySQL database capable of storing large amounts of data as well as the tools needed to create, read, update and delete data. Connecting a MySQL database to a Node.js application using an Express.js server is also discussed.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/12-SQL/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Prior to class, please make sure that you have [installed MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/installing.html) on your machine and be prepared to troubleshoot any issues students may have faced during setup. 

* This week's activities, use MySQL Shell. Please make sure you have your MySQL password ready for use to demonstrate the activities. 

* After starting the MySQL server, make sure that students can initialize the MySQL command-line prompt, using the command `mysql -u root -p`. They will need their MySQL password.

  * If macOS users get the error message `command not found`, they might need to add the following into their `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:
 
    `export PATH="${PATH}:/usr/local/mysql/bin/"`

  * If Windows users get the `command not found` error, refer them to the [MySQL documentation on customizing the PATH](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-installation-windows-path.html)
  mysql-installation-windows-path.html).

* This week's homework uses MySQL, Node.js and Inquirer to build a command line application. For a refresher on Inquirer, refer students to the [NPM documentation on Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/12-SQL/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Heads-Up

During Week 13, students will build on their MySQL skills and learn to use [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify your MySQL queries and easily handle data in a full-stack app.
