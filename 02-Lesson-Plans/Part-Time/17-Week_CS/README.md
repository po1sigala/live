# Unit 17 Instructor Overview: Computer Science for JavaScript  

## Overview

In this unit, we will shift gears a bit to introduce students to general computer-science concepts as they relate to JavaScript. The end goal is to prepare students for the  technical interview portion of the job interview process. While still project-based, this will be a more concept-dense unit than students are accustomed to.

In the first two lessons, we will dissect JavaScript and review how code executes at a granular level. We will also learn about closures and how we can leverage them in our code. Finally, we will compare inheritance and composition in application design. In the final lesson, we will review search algorithms and recursion in JavaScript. 

For the mini-project, students will practice the technical interview portion of a mock interview for a web-developer job with their peers. They'll address topics that are foundational to improving code performance and commonly found in technical interviews.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* In the first lesson, we will explore JavaScript execution and data structures. To prepare, review concepts related to [execution context vs. scope](https://blog.kevinchisholm.com/javascript/difference-between-scope-and-context/) and the [JavaScript execution process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ). To explain JavaScript execution, you should be familiar with the following terminology: thread of execution, execution context, scope chain, event loop, callback queue, and call stack.

* Some activities use a testing library to debug or build code. Lesson content moves fluidly between the browser and Node.js, so familiarize yourself with when you'll use `npm install` to run the test suites. 

* In the second lesson, we teach advanced JavaScript concepts including closures, classes, and factory functions. Take some time before class to review these subjects so you are prepared for questions about lexical environment, composition, and inheritance. Some students might have a hard time understanding these concepts. Encourage them to be patient with themselves, and remind them that the best way to understand these topics is through coding practice. 

* In the third lesson, we will focus primarily on algorithms. To prepare, review the algorithms in the [Resources](#resources) section. Students might struggle to understand some of the algorithms, so encourage patience, practice, asking questions, and seeking resources.

* The mini-project is a departure from past projects in that it is an interactive mock interview with a small group of peers. Encourage students to take the mini-project seriously. The main objective is to practice technical communication in preparation for the real-life interview process. Be sure to check on students frequently to motivate them. Add a personal story about any technical interviews you've done if possible.

* If students struggle with the `bash shell` activity, `27-Evr_Shell`, walk through it with them using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they work on the activity and briefly review it at the end. 

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in the [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, we will return to the back end and learn about NoSQL databases using MongoDB, a popular, document-based database that integrates easily with JavaScript. 

Be sure to have MongoDB and Compass installed on your machine before class. Follow the [How to Install MongoDB](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) to install MongoDB and Compass locally. Also, make sure students have it installed prior to coming to class.

Mongo Atlas, a fully managed cloud database, will be used to deploy the Mini-Project to Heroku. For instructions on how to sign-up for a account and deploy a free cluster, refer to [Set Up MongoDB Atlas](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-set-up-mongodb-atlas).
