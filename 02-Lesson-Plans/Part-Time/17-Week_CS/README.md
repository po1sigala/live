# Unit 17 Instructor Overview: Computer Science For JavaScript  

## Overview

In this unit, we will explore how computer science relates to JavaScript in order to prepare students for technical interviews. This will be a more concept-dense unit than students are used to.

In the first two lessons, we will dissect JavaScript and review how code executes at a granular level. We'll also learn about closures and how we can leverage them in our code. Finally, we will compare inheritance and composition in application design. 

In the final lesson, we will review search algorithms and recursion in JavaScript. For the mini-project, students will practice a mock interview for a web developer job with their peers in order to become familiar with the technical interview process. They'll address topics that are foundational to improving code performance and commonly found in technical interviews.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* On Day 1, we will explain JavaScript execution and data structures. To prepare, review concepts related to [execution context vs. scope](https://blog.kevinchisholm.com/javascript/difference-between-scope-and-context/) and the [JavaScript execution process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ). To explain JavaScript execution, you should be familiar with the following terminology: thread of execution, execution context, scope chain, event loop, callback queue, and call stack.

* A few activities use a testing library to debug or build code. Day 1 moves fluidly between the browser and Node.js, so remind yourself when to use `npm install` to run the test suites. 

* On Day 2, advanced JavaScript concepts include closures, classes, and function factories. Due to the conceptual nature of this topic, students may have some difficulty understanding these concepts. Take some time to review these subjects so you are prepared for questions about lexical environment, composition, and inheritance. Always encourage students to be patient, and let them know that the best way to understand these topics is through coding practice. 

* On Day 3, we will learn about algorithms. Review the common algorithms located in the [Resources](###Resources) section. Students may struggle to understand some of the algorithms, so encourage patience, practice, asking questions, and seeking resources.

* The mini-project is a departure from past projects, because it is an interactive mock interview. Encourage students to take the interview seriously. The main objective is for students to practice technical communication. Be sure to check on students frequently to motivate them. Try to add a personal story about the technical interview process if possible.

* If students struggle with the `bash shell` activity, `27-Evr_Shell`, walk through it with them using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they work on the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/17-CS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, we will return to the back end and learn about NoSQL databases. We will learn about the features of a non-relational database and how it compares to a relational database. Finally, we will touch on why we might use NoSQL for our application.
