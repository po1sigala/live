# 11.3 Lesson Plan—Callbacks & Constructors in the Wild (10:00 AM) <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../02-Day/02-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../../12-Week/01-Day/01-Day-LessonPlan.md)

### Overview

Today's lesson plan will consolidate students' understanding of constructors and formalize the concept of callbacks.

`Summary: Complete activities 11-15 in Unit 11`

##### Attention: If you’re teaching a part time section and this isn’t a Saturday, please use the “Weekday” tab inside of the "03-Day-TimeTracker" for activity lengths instead of those printed on this lesson plan

#### Instructor Priorities

* Students should be able to sketch the architecture of small applications at a high level prior to writing code.
* Students should be able to implement applications with "clean" architectures.
* Students should be able to use objects to consolidate related information.
* Students should be able to use constructors to create those objects.
* Students should be able to articulate the relationship between callbacks and functions that receive them as arguments.

#### Instructor Notes

* The purpose of today's class is to demonstrate the use of constructors in a multi-part application in preparation for the week's homework assignment.

  * Building the TV Show application is the focus of today's lesson. Feel free to cut the callback activity and closure sections if required.

* Have your TAs refer to the [Time Tracker](https://drive.google.com/a/trilogyed.com/file/d/1uNXMV5mOEPxjbjCWkZrrg5L3fT4GyI17/view?usp=sharing) to stay on track.

### Class Objectives

After today's class, students will be able to:

* Sketch the design of their applications _before_ they start to code;

* Use constructors to create objects; and

* Explain callbacks and closures.

---

### 1. Instructor Do: Demonstrate Application (5 mins)

* Take a moment to demonstrate the solved version of the `14-Stu_FinalTVApp` application that students will be building.

  * This application makes use of the [TV Maze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api) to as a data source.

  * Be sure to demonstrate how we can search for TV shows using command line arguments, e.g. `node cli show Westworld`.

  * Demonstrate how we can also search for actors/actresses as well using command line arguments, e.g. `node cli actor Talulah Riley`.

  * Finally point out how each search logs the same information to a `log.txt` file.

    ![TV-App-Example](Images/01-TV-App-Example.gif)

* Explain that we'll proceed step-by-step. Students will:

  * Write out a high-level application architecture;

  * Implement logic for parsing command-line arguments and running the appropriate functionality in a `cli.js` file.

  * Implement the logic for searching for actors or shows using an object generated by a constructor function in a `tv.js` file.

### 2. Partners Do: Sketch Architecture (15 mins)

---

**Objectives Met**

* Sketch the architecture of small applications at a high level prior to writing code;

---

* Remind students that the application:

  * Accepts command-line arguments indicating whether the user intends to search for tv shows or tv actors;

  * Makes an API request to one of two different API endpoints; and

  * Saves the results of the requests to a `log.txt` file and prints the data to the console.

* Slack out the following instructions to students.

  * **Instructions**:

    * As a best practice, sketch out the architecture of your application _before_ you start writing code.

    * For this exercise, start by describing what your application does. Do this in a bullet list.

    * Next, decide how you might divvy up these responsibilities. Would you write a single module that handles all of them? Would you write one module for each bullet list? Something else? Be sure to justify your decision.

    * Finally, draw a diagram describing the flow of your application. Don't worry about being _too_ precise here, but include enough detail where you can use it as a guide to explain it to someone else. You can do this either by using pencil and paper or flowchart generation software like [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/).

    * Take a moment to study the GIF below if stuck. Remember that this application also prints the logged data to a file named `log.txt`.

      ![TV App Example](Images/01-TV-App-Example.gif)

### 3. Instructor Do: Review Activity (5 mins)

* Ask a group to:

  * Share their bullet list;

  * Describe the components they would define; and

  * Explain why they would define their modules this way.

* Briefly discuss the pros and cons of their solution.

* Present the `README.md` file in `11-Stu_Architecture/Solved`, and explain that while there are many ways to write the same application, we've chosen this way to be consistent as we work through the activities as a class.

### 4. Partners Do: Implement CLI (15 mins) (Critical)

---

**Objectives Met**

* Parse command line arguments to determine whether the user is searching for a show or actor, along with which one.

---

* Inform the class that we're going to start with the `CLI` module, since it's the starting point for our application.

* Slack out the following instructions.

  * **Instructions**:

    * When the completed `cli.js` file is run with node, it should be able to handle command line arguments similar to those below:

      ```
      // Search for The Andy Griffith Show

      node cli show The Andy Griffith Show
      ```

      and

      ```
      // Search for the actor Andy Griffith

      node cli actor Andy Griffith
      ```

    * In these examples the cli expects input in the following format:

      ```
      node cli <show-or-actor> <actor-or-show-name>
      ```

    * To begin, open `cli.js` and write code to store the `<show-or-actor>` command line argument in a variable named `search`.

    * Store the `<actor-or-show-name>` command line argument in a variable named `term`. Keep in mind that this argument may contain spaces so it may span multiple indexes of `process.argv`. Check out the [Array Slice Method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/slice) to achieve this.

    * Then write an if/else statement to print to the console whether a show or actor is being searched for.

    * We will add some functionality to actually perform the API calls in the next activity.
  
  * **Bonus**: 

    * Write logic to set up a default search type and default term if either are missing.

### 5. Instructor Do: Review Activity (10 mins)

* Open up the `cli.js` in `12-Stu_Cli/Solved`, and walk through the solution.

  ![CLI Code](Images/03-CLI-Code.png)

* Emphasize:

  * `process.argv` is an array containing the command line arguments.

  * The second index of `process.argv` is the search type argument.

  * All remaining indexes of `process.argv` will contain the actor or tv show search term, split into separate index by spaces. We're using the Array `slice` and `join` methods to collect and format this.

  * We're optionally setting default values for the `search` and `term` variables.

  * We have an if/else statement printing whether a show or actor is being searched for.

* Explain that for now we just have the `console.log` statements, but often times when building applications we need to stub out certain functionality before we have a chance to implement it.

### 6. Partners Do: Implement Find Show (30 mins) (Critical)

---

**Objectives Met**

* Use objects to perform AJAX requests, and save data to local files;

* Use constructors to create those objects;

---


* Slack out the following instructions.

  * **Instructions**:

    * Open the `tv.js` file. This file contains a constructor function that will be used to create a TV object capable of searching the TV Maze API for shows and actors.

    * Install the `axios` package by running `npm install axios` in your terminal. We will use the `axios` module to make AJAX requests to the TV Maze API. Require the `axios` package and the built-in `fs` package at the top of the `tv.js` file.

    * Inside of the `TV` constructor function's `findShow` method, use the `axios` package to hit the TV Maze API for the `URL` string.

    * Once you have the response body of the AJAX request, use `JSON.parse` to convert it to JSON (it comes back as a string).

    * After getting the JSON response from the AJAX request, create a string containing the following information from the returned show data:

      * The name of the show
      * The show's genre(s)
      * The show's average rating
      * The show's network name
      * The show's summary

    * Save this string to the `log.txt` file using the `fs.appendFile` method. If the file does not already exist, `fs.appendFile` will create it.

    * After saving the data to the `log.txt` file, print this information to the console.

    * Verify your code works by running the cli file and passing in the name of a TV show, e.g. `node cli show Scrubs`. This should print the specified information to the console and save it to the `log.txt` file.

  * **Hints**:

    * Check out some sample output from the TV Maze single show search API: <http://api.tvmaze.com/singlesearch/shows?q=scrubs>.

    * You would have used the `axios` package for the Liri HW assignment. Refer back to this if you need a refresher on how to use the package.

    * Check out the selected answer for the question: [how to append a file in node?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3459476/how-to-append-to-a-file-in-node)

### 7. Instructor Do: Review Activity (10 mins) (Critical)

* Open up the `tv.js` in `13-Stu_FindShow/Solved`, and walk through the solution.

  ![Find Show](Images/04-Find-Show-Code.png)

* Emphasize:

  * We use the `axios` package to search the TV Maze API, and parse the body as JSON.

  * `showData` is just a big multi-line string containing the data we we'll be using. Using an array of strings we join together can be a more human readable way to achieve this than concatenation.

  * We use the `fs.appendFile` method to save this information along with a divider &mdash; just a series of dashes &mdash; to the `log.txt` file.

  * When complete we log the data to the console.

  * Point out how we call the `tv.findShow` method in the `cli.js` file.

* Slack out the solution so students can use it as as starting point as they move forward.

### 8. Partners Do: Implement Find Actor (25 mins) (Critical)

---

**Objectives Met**

* Use objects to perform AJAX requests, and save data to local files;

* Use constructors to create those objects;

---

* Slack out the following instructions.

  * **Instructions**:

    * Open `tv.js` and update the constructor function's `findActor` method. It should use the `axios` package to search the TV Maze API using the provided URL.

    * Once the data has been retrieved from the API, parse it as JSON (it should be a string initially) and grab only the first result (it should be an array of JSON objects).

    * Save the following information to the `log.txt` file using the `fs.appendFile` method:

      * The actor's name
      * The actor's birthday
      * The actor's gender
      * The actor's country
      * The actor's TV Maze URL

    * Once the data has been saved to the `log.txt` file, print it to the console.

    * Test that your code works properly by running the `cli.js` file with arguments. e.g. `node cli actor Jennifer Aniston`.

  * **Bonus**:

    * Once you've finished the basic activity, update the `cli.js` file to use the `inquirer` npm package to prompt the user for their search and term rather than `process.argv`.

  * **Hints**:

    * Implementing the `findActor` method should be very similar to the `findShow` method, refer to this if stuck.

    * Check out this sample output from the TV Maze Actors API: <http://api.tvmaze.com/search/people?q=jennifer%20aniston>

### 9. Instructor Do: Review Activity (15 mins) (Critical)

* Open up the `tv.js` inside `14-Stu_FinalTVApp/Basic/Solved` file, and walk through the solution.

  ![Find Actor](Images/05-Find-Actor-Code.png)

  * Point out how the code here is very similar to the findShow method.

  * This API endpoint returns an array of actor objects, for our purposes we only want the first result, so we grab the 0th index.

* Answer any remaining questions and slack out the solution.

### 10. Everyone Do: Application Review (10 mins)

* Demonstrate the completed application, and have students follow along.

* Foster discussion around the benefits of planning an architecture before writing any code.

  * Also discuss any possible improvements. What else could we add to this application? 
  
  * Check out the [TV Maze API Documentation Site](https://www.tvmaze.com/api). Point out that we can also search for TV crew or seasons.

  * Highlight the fact that we're very close to creating what could be a useful NPM package someone else may want to use.

* Take this time to address any outstanding questions students may have.

---

### 11. BREAK (45 mins)

---

### 12. Instructor Do: Callbacks (15 mins) (High)

**Objectives Met**

* Articulate the relationship between callbacks and functions that receive them as arguments.

---

* Remind students that we can assign functions as values to variables.

* Explain that, since functions are values, we can pass them as arguments to functions.

  * Point out that we've used callbacks extensively with jQuery &mdash; every time we use event listeners, as well as with the fs package &mdash; when we write a function to handle what happens after data is read, written, appended, etc.

* Explain that functions passed as arguments to other functions are called **callbacks**.

  * Explain that this is because we typically intend for the function _receiving_ the callback to do some work, and then **call back** the function we pass with its results.

  * Explain what happens when we call `fs.appendFile`:

    * First, `fs.appendFile` adds the text we pass in to the file that we specify.

    * Then, one of two things happens. Either:

      * `fs.appendFile` hits an error writing to the file. In this case, _it calls the function we've given it with an **error** argument_.

      * `fs.appendFile` writes the data we want. In this case, _it calls the function we've given it and does not pass it an error.

    * In either case, the `fs.appendFile` function does some work, and then **calls us back** when complete so we can do something afterwards.

  * Explain that callbacks are one way for us to handle what happens right after some asynchronous code completes.

### 13. Students Do: Callbacks Activity (15 mins) (High)

* Slack out the following instructions.

  * **Instructions**:

    * Write a function that accepts a string and a function as arguments. It should log the string, and then run the function.

    * Write a function that accepts a boolean value and a function as arguments. It should run the function if and only if the boolean argument is true.

    * Write a function that accepts a function(F) and a value (V), and returns a function that returns the result of running F on V. This sounds tricky, but it's easier than it sounds—just take it step by step!

    * Finally, write a short message to a file using `fs.writeFile`. Does this function use callbacks? If so, identify them.

### 14. Instructor Do: Review Activity (10 mins)

* Open up `callbacks.js` in `15-Callbacks/Solved`, and step through the solution.

  * Pay special attention to:

    * Explaining that, in each example, `func` is a value that contains a **function**. This is why we can put parentheses after it—this _calls_ the function.

    * Explaining that, when we pass a function a callback, we can do other work _before_ we call the callback. This allows us to reuse functions we already have, but **decorate** them but doing "extra stuff".

      * Briefly explain the notion of function decoration.

* Emphasize that students have been using callbacks from the beginning of their JavaScript studies. Today's lesson simply associates the concept with a name.

* Slack out the solutions and take a few moments to answer outstanding questions.

### 15. End (0 mins)

* **Over Slack tell everyone to download MySQL Workbench so that they are prepared for next class!**

### MySQL Install

* We will be coming up on MySQL next class. Let student's know to install MySQL Server and Workbench. Guides have been provided so slack these out to students:

  * [MySQL Install Mac](../../12-Week/01-Day/Install_Guides/mysql-mac-guide.md)
  * [MySQL Install Windows](../../12-Week/01-Day/Install_Guides/mysql-windows-guide.md)

* If your class runs into trouble with this install process, feel free to use MAMP or any other installation solution that you would prefer to get the class ready.
