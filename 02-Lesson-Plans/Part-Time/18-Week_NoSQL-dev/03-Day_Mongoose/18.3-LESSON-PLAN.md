# 18.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Mongoose

## Overview

This lesson plan will cover the creating computed properties in Mongoose with something called a virtual property. You will also cover populating a sub document in Mongoose after it has been created. Finally, you will go through the various create, read, update, and delete operations that you can perform on a Mongoose document.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Stu_Aggregates` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Students might find it difficult to understand the difference between data that gets stored in the database, and information that gets computed on the fly using virtual properties. Be sure to read the [Mongoose Virtual Properties Documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#virtuals_virtuals) prior to class to ensure that help teach students the difference between the two.

* Most activities in this lesson will require students to run the seed script by running `npm run seed` or `yarn seed` in the terminal inside the `Unsolved` directory for each activity.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain and execute CRUD methods with MongoDB

* Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB

* Implement a Mongoose virtual property to create computed properties that are not stored in the database

> **Important**: If this lesson occurs on a weekday, you'll follow a different schedule to accommodate for the shorter class time. The `Stoke Curiosity` section is shortened by 5 minutes, the break by 25 minutes, and the `Student Do: Mini-project` by 10 minutes, and the `Everyone Do: Git` activity is omitted completely.
