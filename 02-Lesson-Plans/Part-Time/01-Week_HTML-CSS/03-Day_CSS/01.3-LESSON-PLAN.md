# 01.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: CSS Layout and the Box Model

## Overview 

Today's lesson will delve further into CSS and introduce the box model and layout using the display and position properties. Students will also work together to complete a mini-project that reinforces HTML and CSS fundamentals.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `15-Ins_HTML-display` through `22-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be ready to view and edit CSS in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to the Google documentation [Get Started With Viewing And Changing CSS](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css).

* During activities, encourage students to use the provided user stories and acceptance criteria in their activity instructions to identify the user's goal and conditions that must be met for the solution to be accepted. This will help reinforce the computational thinking skills practiced during the first class and set them up for success for future coding challenges. 

* For the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, be prepared to demonstrate configuring the local git default branch to `main` as well as creating a Git repository using `git init`. If needed, please review [Git Basics - Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) prior to class, so you feel prepared to handle any student questions as they arise. 

* Help students do a `git pull` of the class repository to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* This week's mini-project builds on the fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS learned this week. Encourage the students to look back on previous activities, as needed, to refresh their memory and for help with syntax.

* While students will be put into groups for the mini-project, they will each work on their own projects. But encourage them to brainstorm together and share their learnings. This will be the first of many opportunities for students to collaborate and work together in groups. 

* This mini-project is also the first experience some students may have with building a coding project from scratch. Remind the students to break down the project into small, manageable steps and to use both the user story and acceptance criteria as a guide to help arrive at a step-by-step solution. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use the CSS display property to set an element as an inline or block element.

* Determine how an element is positioned in an HTML document using the CSS position property.

* Identify the box model and its role in web design and layout.

* Configure local Git default branch

* Initialize a local repository using `git init`

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Explain that when web developers build projects, they often rely on tools to help them troubleshoot issues and build pages faster.

* And one of the most powerful tools is available right in your web browser!

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Open Chrome DevTools by pressing `Command+Option+J (Mac)` or `Control+Shift+J` (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS).

  * Tell the students that Chrome DevTools has many features useful for developers for debugging and even experimenting with the code right in the browser.
  
  * Navigate to the `Styles` tab on the `Elements` panel and note the CSS listed in the panel.
  
  * Hover over a CSS property and click to uncheck the box. Note the style change on the webpage.
  
  * Change the `background-color` property in the body to `purple` to further demonstrate how you can manually change a value.
  
  * Explain that changing CSS right in the browser is a great way to experiment with style properties.
  
  * Add that another useful feature of DevTools is that you can check an element's accessibility by simply hovering over the image.
  
  * Click on the pointer icon and then hover over an element on the page. A box should appear that indicates the element's accessibility including the role as read by an accessibility device. If applicable, a contrast score will also be indicated.
  
  * Note that having enough contrast between colors is important to make sure your page is viewable to a range of users and Chrome DevTools is an easy way to check if you page is easy to read. 
  
  * Encourage the students to experiment with Chrome DevTools as they build their own projects later in the class.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Display (5 min) 

* Open `15-Ins_HTML-display/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë The CSS display property can be used to set an element to display inline or block.

  * üîë Inline elements are elements that only take up as much width as needed and do not automatically start a new line.

  * Images and `<a>` elements are examples of elements that are inline elements.
  
  * üîë Blocks elements are elements that always start on a new line and take up as much width as available.

  * Paragraph and unordered lists are examples of block elements.

  * üîë We use the `display` property to set if an element behaves as an inline or block element. 

  * We can also use display to hide an element.

* Open `15-Ins_HTML-display/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We use `display: block` to set an element to block. A block element will take up the whole width available.

    ```css
    .display-block {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

  * We use `display: inline` to set an element to inline. An inline element will only take up the width needed. 

    ```css
    .display-inline {
      display: inline;
    }
    ```

  * We use `display: none` to completely remove an image. It will not appear on the page and no longer takes up space in the layout. 

    ```css
    .display-none {
      display: none;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between an inline and block element?

  * üôã An inline element will only take up as much width as needed. In contrast, a block element will take up as much width as available. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `15-Ins_HTML-display/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Display (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `15-Ins_HTML-display/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üêõ List Items and Boxes are Not Displaying Correctly

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

  * Users should be able to see a horizontal navigation bar with three list items side-by-side.

  * Users should be able to see three boxes.

  * Users should be able to see the boxes centered and stacked on top of each other.

  ## Expected Behavior

  * All three list items in the navigation bar should display inline.

  * All three boxes should be visible. 

  * Each box should appear centered and on its own line.

  ## Actual Behavior

  * Each list item in the navigation bar displays on its own line.

  * Two boxes are visible and one is not displayed.

  * The two visible boxes display inline and aligned to the left. 

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ## üí° Hints

  What display property is used to hide an element? 

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the CSS visibility property? How is it different from the display property?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Display (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with using display? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: inline`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: block`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: none`

* Open `16-Stu_HTML-Display/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * In this activity, we are asked to debug broken code so that user's goals -- as stated in the user story -- are met and the app behaves as expected.

  * üîë Currently, each list item in the navigation bar displays on its own line. To meet the expected behavior and have each list item display inline, we use the the display property to set the behavior to inline.

    ```css
    li {
      display: inline;
      ...
    }
    ```

  * The boxes, which are images, are inline elements. To set them as block elements, we use `display: block`.

    ```css
    img {
      display: block;
      margin: 0 auto;
    }
    ```

  * üîë The third box `image-3` was set to `display: none`. This means that the box is not visible and is not taking up space. To make the box visible, we use `display: block` to match the expected behavior. 

    ```css
    #image-3 {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

* Open `16-Stu_HTML-Display/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * We open the webpage in the browser to test to make sure the expected behavior is not visible on the screen. It works!

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use the `display` property to change how an element appears on the page?

  * üôã We can set an element to `display: inline` so it will only take up as much width as needed.  We can set an element to `display: block` so that it takes up the entire width available. We use `display: none` if we want to completely remove an item.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Box Model (5 min) 

* Open `17-Ins_CSS-box-model/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  *  In HTML, all elements are boxes. We use the term `box model` to help describe the amount of space that each element will take in space.

  * The innermost layer of the box is the content itself. The content has height and width.

  * The next layer is the padding that surrounds the content. We use CSS to set the width of the padding. 

  * The border surrounds the padding. Like the padding, the width of the border is set by CSS.

  * Finally, the margin is the area outside the border. 

* Open `17-Ins_CSS-box-model/assets/css/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use CSS to set the width of the padding, border, and margins.

  * The CSS `padding` property sets the width of the padding. All sides will have a width of 20px.

    ```css
    padding: 20px;
    ```

  * The CSS `border` property sets the width of the border, the type of the border and the color.

    ```css
    border: 10px solid darkblue;
    ```

  * The CSS `margin` property sets the width of the margin. The margin on each side is 20px.

    ```css
    margin: 20px;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are the four components of the box model?

  * üôã The content, the padding, the border, and the margin

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How is understanding the box model useful for layout and design?

  * üôã The box model explains how much space an element will take on a page. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Box Model (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Mockup](./assets/image-1.png)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * How can we use the margin property to define space between elements?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is the CSS float property?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Box Model (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the box model? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è margin

  * ‚úîÔ∏è padding
  
  * ‚úîÔ∏è border

* Open `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * To meet the acceptance criteria, we must center all four images inside the box evenly. 

  * The box has a width of 600px and a height of 600px. For our images to fit inside the box, the total combined space they take up -- including the content, padding, border, and margin -- will have to be less.

    ```css
    section {
      width: 600px;
      height: 600px;
      text-align: center;
      border: 15px solid black;
    }
    ```

  * The width and height of the content is 200px.

    ```css
    width: 200px;
    height: 200px;
    ```

  * üîë First, we set the margin on every side to be 20px. 

    ```css
    margin: 20px;
    ```

  * üîë We set the padding to be 20px as well.

    ```css
    padding: 20px;
    ```

  * üîë Finally, we set the width of the border to be 9px, make it a solid border, and give it a color of dark blue.

    ```css
    border: 9px solid darkblue;
    ```

* Open `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * The total width of the image is now 20 (left margin) + 9 (border) + 20 (left padding)  + 200 (image) + 20 (right padding) + 9 (border) + 20 (right margin) or 298px.

  * The total height of the image is also 298px.

  * Since the width of the containing box is 600px and the height is 600px, the boxes fit evenly.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between the padding and margin? 

  * üôã The padding is the space between the content and the border. Padding surrounds the content. Margins determine the space surrounding an element. Both are often adjusted when designing a layout to make an element fit in a space.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Positioning (5 min) 

* Open `19-Ins_CSS-positioning/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use the CSS `position` property to set how the element is positioned in a document.

  * The default position is `static`. An element in the `static` position is positioned based on the normal flow.

  * When an element's position is `relative` it stays in the normal flow but can be offset by a value provided in the CSS.

  * When an element's position is `absolute` it is no longer in the normal flow. Instead, the element is positioned relative to its ancestor element and is determined by values provided for top, bottom, left, and right.

  * An element in the `fixed` position is also not in the normal flow. However, unlike `absolute`, the position is determined in relationship to the viewport.

* Open `19-Ins_CSS-positioning/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë To set an element to `relative`, we use `position: relative`. We offset the element using the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. Here, we position the element to be 200px from the left:

    ```css
    #relative-box {
      position: relative;
      left: 200px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To set an element to `absolute`, we first set the parent element to `relative`.

    ```css
    #absolute-section {
      position: relative;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We then use `position: absolute` and use the the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to position the item relative to the parent container. Here, we position the element to be 50px from the top and 100px from the right inside the container.

    ```css
    #absolute-box {
      position: absolute;
      top: 50px;
      right: 100px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë To set the element to `fixed`, we use `position: fixed`. We then use values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` to position the element relative to the viewport. Here, we position the element to be fixed in the bottom right corner of the screen.

    ```css
    #fixed-box {
      position: fixed;
      bottom: 0;
      right: 0;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use the CSS `position` property to change the layout of our webpage?

  * üôã We use the `position` property to set how an element is positioned in the document.
  This allows us to move and rearrange elements or even fix them in a certain position relative to the viewport. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_CSS-positioning/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Positioning (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_CSS-positioning/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  * In this activity, we need to use absolute and relative positioning to re-position `box 2` in each of the squares.

  * To start, we take a look at the dimensions of `square 1` and `square 2`, which have a class of `container`. The height is 600px and the width is 600px.  

    ```css
    .container {
      width: 600px;
      height: 600px;
      margin: 20px auto;
      border: 15px solid black;
    }
    ```

  * Since we can fit 3 boxes vertically in the square, we can know that the dimensions of the boxes are 200px. This will be useful in deciding how much to offset the box so it is in middle.

  * üîë  To position `box 2` in the middle of the `square 1`, we will need to set the position of `relative-box-2` to `relative`. Then, we offset it from its original position to the left 200px. This will move the box to the center of the square. 

  ```css
  #relative-box-2 {
    position: relative;
    left: 200px;
  }
  ```

  * To use absolute positioning, we first need to set the parent element to relative. Therefore `square 2` has an additional class of `absolute-container`.

  ```css
  .absolute-container {
    position: relative;
  }
  ```

  * üîë  Then, to move `box 2` outside of `square 2`, we set the position of `absolute-box-2` to `absolute`, and set the top to 0 and the left to 700px.

  ```css
  #absolute-box-2 {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    left: 700px;
  }
  ```

* Time permitting, you can explain the other CSS using the comments provided.

* Open `20-Stu_CSS-Positioning/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * When we open the webpage, we see the acceptance criteria has been met and our webpage matches the mockup. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between absolute and relative positioning?

  * üôã Relative positioning offsets an image relative to its original position but does not change the layout of the other elements around it. Absolute positioning positions itself relative to its parent container and is removed from the flow, changing the layout of other elements around it. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `21-Evr_Git-Guide/README.md`.

### 11. Everyone Do: Git (20 min)

* Students have already gone over the basics of creating a remote repository on GitHub as well as commonly used Git commands on Day 1. This Git activity will focus on configuring the local Git default branch to `main`, using `git init` to create a local repository, and reviewing the `git pull` command since they will use it frequently to pull down the class repository before every class.

* Open [Git Basics - Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Git is an important tool that allows developers to track and store versions of content. Using a Git repository, we can save versions of our code. 

  * Creating a repository is an important part of the development process and should be done each time you start a new project.

  * We can create a repository and use it on our local machines in two ways. We can create the remote repository on GitHub first and then use `git clone` to clone it onto our local machine. Or we can take a local directory or project and turn it into a Git repository using `git init`.

  * We already went over how to clone a remote repository on Day 1, so today we will go over how to turn an existing local project into a Git repository.

  * But first, we will need to configure our local Git default branch to `main`.
  
* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `21-Evr_Git-Guide/README.md`.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Before we begin, it is important to make sure our default branch is `main`. If you have not done so, please follow the instructions in the Git Guide and use `git config` to make that switch. If you have any issues, please reach out to a TA or stay for Office Hours so we can help. 

    ```bash
    git config --global init.defaultBranch main
    ```

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Using `git init`is an alternative way to create a repository and the results are similar to using `git clone`. However, unlike `git clone`, we start by creating a repository locally via the command line first. 

  * üîë We start by creating a new project directory named `git-init-sample` on your local machine. Ideally, you should have a parent directory to store all of your coding projects for this course. Create this project directory inside that parent directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir git-init-sample
    ```

  * To add a file to our new project directory, we use `cd` to navigate into the directory and `touch` to add an `index.html`.

    ```bash
    cd git-init-sample
    touch index.html
    ```

  * To initialize this folder as a Git repository, use `git init`. It is important that we are in our project folder when we run this command!

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

  * This creates a new subdirectory named `.git` that contains all of our necessary repository files&mdash;a Git repository skeleton. 

  * To start version-controlling the existing files in our project, we need to start tracking those files and do an initial commit.

  * First let's run `git status` to check the status of our files.

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

  * We should see that our `index.html` is currently untracked. Let's stage that file for commit. 

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

  * Now if we run `git status` again, we should see that the file is being tracked and is ready to be committed.

    ```bash
    git commit -m "initial commit"
    ```

  * üîë Using `git init` adds version control locally to a project, but it doesn't create a remote repository. So let's do that now!

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Click on the New button to create a new repository.

  * Enter the same name as our local repository `git-init-sample`.

  * üîë Do not check any of the checkboxes since we are importing an existing repository!

  * Click the `Create Repository` button.

  * Copy the code under under the header "‚Ä¶or push an existing repository from the command line".

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Back in your project directory, paste the commands copied from GitHub. This will sync your local repository with the repository you just created on GitHub.

* Open the `git-init-sample` repository on GitHub in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Our repository has been updated on GitHub. Success! 

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Lastly, let's go over `git pull`. You will need to pull down the class repository to have that day's activities ready for every class.

  * To perform a `git pull`, first navigate to the project directory using `cd`.

    ```bash
    cd git-init-sample
    ```

  * Next, use `git pull` to pull down the changes from the remote. Just like when we did a `git push`, we use `origin` to represent the original directory&mdash;or more precisely the original repository's URL&mdash;followed by the name of the branch. The name of our branch is `main.`

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

  * The changes made, if any, can be viewed by opening the project directory in VS Code.

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

### 12. BREAK (40 min)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini-Project (5 min) 

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The mini-project is an opportunity for you to implement what you learned in the unit and work together in a group to create an application in class. 

  * üîë For our first mini-project, we will be creating a landing page using HTML and CSS. Each of you will work on your own landing page, however you will still be put into groups so you can brainstorm and work together through the specifications of the mini-project.

  * üîë The landing page will have a contact form.

  * üîë The landing page will have a header, footer, and an image.

  * üîë The landing page should also use semantic HTML and be accessible. 

  * Be creative! You can choose your own colors, text, and image.

  * üîë You may need to do a bit of research on your own! As in real life, you will not always be given everything you need to complete a task. As developers, we will need to learn how to research and find answers to our questions in order to finish the work. 

  * When approaching a complex coding problem like this, it is important to break down the challenge into manageable chunks. Work in your groups to figure out the steps to complete this mini-project. 

  * üîë Also, don't forget to refer frequently to the `user story` and `acceptance criteria`. Checking your work against the user's goal as stated in the `user story` and the conditions established in the `acceptance criteria` is a great way to stay on track. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will use HTML to build the structure and CSS to style the page. 

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini-project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini-Project (60 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Unit 01 Mini-Project: Landing Page

  In this mini-project, you will build a landing page using HTML and CSS. While you will be responsible for your own landing page, you will work together in groups to brainstorm and share ideas.

  ## Instructions

  Work in your group to implement the following user stories:

  * As a client, I want to view a single web page that collects a visitor's contact information.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

  * As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

  ### Specifications

  The completed application should meet the following acceptance criteria:

  * Uses semantic HTML elements.

  * Uses universal, element and class selectors in CSS.

  * Uses at least three colors in design.

  * Uses a single font and font family for all text on page.

  * Uses at least two heading `<h1>...<h6>` tags.

  * The header should be fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

  * The header should contain a navigation bar with three links that display inline including a `contact` link.

  * When the `contact` link is clicked, the page should jump directly to the contact form.

  * The contact form should include `input` elements for name and email.

  * The contact form should include a Send `button`.

  * The image should include a descriptive `alt` attribute.

  * The mini-project should be deployed to GitHub Pages.

  ## üí° Notes

  Follow these instructions to deploy your project to GitHub Pages:

  1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

  2. When you're ready to deploy, use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

  3. Navigate to your GitHub repository in your browser and then navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab on the right side of the repository's page.

  4. From the settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `main` branch as your source.

  5. Navigate to `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `lernantino` and the project is `css-demo-site`, your URL would be `lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site`)

  You can also refer to this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) to walk through the steps needed to deploy.

  **Important**: It may take a few moments for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project doesn't deploy or show up, make sure that all file paths in your application are relative and using the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, so there is a difference between a capitalized and uncapitalized letter to them.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini-Project  (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Semantic HTML

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `alt` attribute

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `display: inline`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `position: fixed`

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * Everyone's landing page will look different, so don't worry if yours doesn't look exactly like what we are about to go over right now. As long as your landing page fulfills all of the specifications of the project, you did great!

  * We use `<link>` to link our HTML page to the CSS. The `<link>` is placed in the `<head>` and has an `href` attribute set the the relative path to our CSS stylesheet.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./assets/css/style.css/">
    ```

  * üîë We use semantic HTML to define the header and an unordered list to create a list of links. 

    ```html
    <header>
      <nav class="text-right">
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#">Portfolio</a></li>
          <li> <a href="#contact">Contact</a></li>
        </ul>
      </nav>
    </header>
    ```

  * We use a `<h1>` section heading for the title. 

    ```html
    <h1 class="text-center">My New Website</h1>
    ```

  * üîë We use a `<figure>` element to add an image and a caption. We use an `alt` attribute to describe our image.

    ```html
    <figure>
        <img src="./assets/images/image-1.png" alt="Graphic with Coming Soon text">
        <figcaption class="text-center">Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    ```

  * We use semantic HTML to define a section for the contact form. Inside, the `<section>`, we add a sub-header. For accessibility, it is important that our section headings are in descending order. So, since we used a `<h1>` above, we use a `<h2>`.

    ```html
    <section id="contact">
        <h2 class="text-center">Contact Me</h2>
    ```

  * To create a form, we had to do a bit of research. An internet search is a great way to quickly learn how to use an unfamiliar element in your webpage.

    ```html
    <form>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <label class="text-right" for="name">Name:</label>
          <input type="text" id="name" name="user-name">
        </li>
        <li>
          <label class="text-right" for="email">Email:</label>
          <input type="text" id="email" name="user-email">
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="text-center">
        <button type="submit">SEND</button>
      </div>
    </form>
    ```

  * Finally, we added a footer. The footer has a `class` attribute used for styling. 

    ```html
    <footer class="text-center">
      ¬© 2021 My New Website Productions 
    </footer>
    ```

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We use a universal selector to set the margin and padding to all elements to 0.

    ```css
    * {
      margin:0;
      padding:0;  
    }
    ```

  * üîë We use an element selector to select all the list items and set the display property to `inline`. This will give us a horizontal set of links in the navbar.

    ```css
    li {
      display: inline;
      padding: 20px;
      text-decoration: none;
    }
    ``` 

  * üîë To keep the header fixed to the top of the viewport, we set the position to `fixed`.

    ```css
    header {
      position: fixed;
      border-bottom: 10px solid #DDAF94;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it important to design our webpages with accessibility in mind? 

  * üôã Designing an accessible website makes it easier for more users to visit your site.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Structuring the web with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML),  [MDN Web Docs on Learn to style HTML using CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS)and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Homework (5 min)

* Open `02-Homework/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * During this week's homework, you will take an existing website and use the HTML and CSS skills practiced during this week to make sure the site is accessible using the provided guidelines.

  * Accessibility is an increasingly important consideration in web design. Inclusive design aims to make sure all users -- including those with disabilities -- are able to interact and understand a web page's content.

  * During activities this week, we had a brief introduction to the use of semantic HTML and accessibility concerns. This project will require you to dive a little deeper and do a bit of research to make sure the goal stated in the `user story` and each `acceptance criteria` is fully addressed. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to build an website using HTML and CSs that is accessible to all users. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We will use our skills in HTML and CSS to refactor an existing webpage and build off of the accessibility concepts covered in class.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã As a developer, it is important to be able to design a website with all users in mind. 

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Homework Requirements found in `02-Homework/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
