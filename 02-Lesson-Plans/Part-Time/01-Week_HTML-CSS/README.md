# Unit 01 Instructor Overview: HTML, CSS, and Git  

## Overview

In this unit, you will introduce students to HTML, CSS, and version control with Git.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* During the first 70 minutes of the first class, the university will lead introductory activities and provide important course-specific information to the students. 

* Also during the first class, you will review the tools that students will need in this course, including Slack, VS Code, and GitHub. Refer to the [Slack workspace set-up guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace), the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and the [GitHub Docs on setting up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) to review set-up and installation on both Windows and Mac machines.

* Remind students that they can always refer to their prework for more detailed installation instructions. However, if a student is struggling to install or use the required tools, encourage them to stay for office hours for additional help.

* In addition to HTML, CSS, and Git fundamentals, the activities for this week also aim to familiarize students with classroom expectations. Make sure to emphasize the importance of doing a `git pull` of the class repo before each class. 

* For the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, be prepared to demonstrate configuring the local Git default branch to `main` as well as creating a Git repository using `git init`. You might want to review [Git Basics—Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) ahead of time to prepare for student questions that might arise. 

* The mini-project builds on the fundamental HTML and CSS concepts covered this week. Students will each work on their own projects, but they will be put into groups so that they can brainstorm together and share their learnings. This will be the first of many opportunities for them to collaborate in groups. 

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, students will build on CSS and other fundamentals as they delve into responsive web design and advanced CSS.
