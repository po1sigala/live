# 13.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Object Relational Mapping (ORM)

## Overview 

@TODO Write a two or three-sentence overview of the lesson plan.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `XX-Ins_Demo-Title` through `XX-Stu_Activity-Title`

* @TODO Each Instructor Note block begins with the bullet above, outlining what activities will be covered during class.

* @TODO Empathize with the instructor. If you only had one hour to prepare for class, what are the things you would want to know up front? What are the potential pitfalls in class? Where are students going to get hung up? 

* @TODO Set the instructor up for success.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* @TODO Bullet the learning objectives for the lesson plan. Refer to your Activity Planner.

* @TODO When writing learning objectives, refer to this list of measurable verbs used to assess learning outcomes https://www.clinton.edu/curriculumcommittee/listofmeasurableverbs.cxml

* @TODO For example, "Initialize projects and install third-party packages using npm"

* @TODO If it's a concept and not a demonstrable skill, use "explain". For example, "Explain the client-server model"

* @TODO Don't use "Understand..." as it is not measurable

* @TODO Aim for at least 3 points, but no more than 6. If you find yourself listing more than six points you may need to rethink the scope of your points or the lesson plan itself.
