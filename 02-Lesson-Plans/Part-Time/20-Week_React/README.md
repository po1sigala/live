# Unit 20 Instructor Overview: React

## Overview

In this unit, you will teach students how to create a React single-page application (SPA) from the ground up. Through this process, students will learn about components, state, props, React styling, and how to test React applications. They will also learn how to use `create-react-app` to scaffold their React apps. You will help them render elements in JSX and write JSX expressions. You will also help them understand more complex topics like React Hooks, fetching data, and creating fully functional React forms.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/20-React/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Be sure to take some time to review the official React documentation, as there have been some important recent changes concerning React import statements. As of React version 17, it's no longer required to import React in order to process JSX. This unit, however, does still include the import statements, as this was a very recent change.

* Make sure you're well-versed in React Hooks so that you can explain how they work to students, who might be confused at first about this different approach to building web app UIs.

* The homework for this unit invites students to create an updated portfolio that demonstrates their newly acquired React skills. Students will be required to deploy their application to GitHub Pages for submission. Be sure to review the [React Docs on deployment](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages) so that you can help students with their homework.

* This unit uses `create-react-app` for the first activity to create a "practice" React app. This app will be used for the entire unit by swapping out only the `src/` directory before each activity.

* Make sure that you have installed `npx` so that you can demonstrate `create-react-app`. To check the installation, run `npx --version` in the command line.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/20-React/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* For more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/additionalresources).

## Heads-Up

During the next unit, you will build on React foundations, and guide students through application development using three-layer MERN architecture.  You will also introduce students to the GraphQL Playground and Apollo Server. If you are new to the GraphQL and the GraphQL Playground or Apollo Server, please refer to theÂ Apollo Docs on GraphQL Playground and the [Apollo Docs on introduction to Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).

>> Important: The GraphQL activities and instructor demonstrations require a minimum npm version of 7.0.0 or greater. Prior to class, please be sure to check your npm version and update if needed. Refer to the [NPM docs on updating to latest stable version.](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm).

* **Important**: React Router recently [upgraded to version 6](https://reactrouter.com/docs/en/v6/upgrading/v5#upgrade-to-react-router-v6) which includes breaking changes with `<Switch>`, `<Redirect> ` and other elements. The content of Unit 21 uses React Router version 5. To make sure that students can follow along with activities -- as currently written -- please instruct students to use this npm command to install React Router version 5: `npm install react-router-dom@5`.
