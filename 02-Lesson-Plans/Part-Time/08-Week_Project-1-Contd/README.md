## Overview

In this unit students will continue working with their project groups. They will also have the opportunity to practice whiteboard interview questions under pressure.

## Instructor / TA Notes

### Algorithms

Throughout the unit, bring each student to the whiteboard one at a time. If there's no whiteboard available, bring the student to a part of the class separate from other students and have them work on the problem on their laptop in front of you -- preferably on a piece of paper or on a computer using notepad or a program without any kind of intellisense.

Explain the problem to the student, show them one or more of the example inputs/outputs provided with the problem. Inform the student that they'll have 10 minutes to complete as much of the problem as possible.

If the student says they're stuck, or goes quiet for up to a minute, offer up a hint. Some are found at the bottom of the Instructions.md file for the problem.

Focus on giving students positive feedback on what they did well. Explain that part of whiteboarding interviews is to see how well they can communicate with the interviewer and that it's possible to do well even without arriving at a correct answer.

### Projects

Make sure to remind students that they should try dealing with merge conflicts and deployment issues as early as possible to avoid broken projects.

## Heads Up

* In the next unit, students will start using Node.js. Be sure to direct students to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs) before starting Unit 09.

## Career Connection

Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [important folder](../../../01-Class-Content/08-Project-1-Contd/04-Important/CAREER-CONNECTION.md).
