# 17.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Algorithms, Recursion, and the Technical Interview

## Overview 

Today's lesson takes a step away from more JavaScript-specific topics of the previous lessons and introduces students to algorithms they may be faced with during an interview. The class will cover search algorithms, recursion, and mock-interview practice with sorting algorithms.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Linear-Search` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Since [Big O notation](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) is difficult in an activity, spend a little time at the beginning of class explaining it and bringing it up after each algorithm is reviewed to help students visualize the difference in complexity for each one.

* The mini project this week requires students be broken into teams of two or three and not the usual group project setting. It is a simulation of a technical interviewer with one student will assume the role of the interviewer and the other will assume the role of the candidate. If students are struggling to get started, make sure they know that this is to help them gather their thoughts and what to think about in a real interview, and they should revisit this on their own time. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Shell` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. They may not be able to finish, but that's okay!

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement a linear search algorithm

* Use recursion to solve a fibonacci sequence algorithm

* Implement a binary search algorithm and know when to use it over a linear search algorithm.

* Write shell scripts to be executed from the command line.

* Articulate and implement sorting algorithms in a technical interview setting.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Explain that even though most of us are going to apply for JavaScript related jobs, the technical interview will usually include an assessment of our knowledge in some computer science topics.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ In computing, what is an algorithm?

  * 🙋 An algorithm is a self-contained series of steps that describes a way to solve a problem for a human or a machine. 

  * ☝️ Are algorithms the same thing as functions? 

  * 🙋 Nope, an algorithm is an abstracted idea of how to solve a problem and functions are a means of implementing those steps.

  * ☝️ Why would it be important for a full-stack JavaScript developer to understand and articulate how to implement popular computer science algorithms? 

  * 🙋 Understanding algorithms helps developers think about a problem in a more conceptual and abstracted way, allowing them to more efficiently come to a solution and ultimately be better developers.

  * ☝️ Do we think some algorithms can solve problems quicker than others?

  * 🙋 Yes, and it usually depends on the type of problem being solved. That's why it's important for us to know how different types of algorithms do in different situations.  

* Open [the Big-O Cheat Sheet](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/) and explain the following while walking through the chart:

  * 🔑 In computer science, we measure an algorithm's efficiency by finding the potential amount of steps it will take to solve a problem in a worst-case scenario in relation to the size of the data it's being performed on. 

  * 🔑 This is what's known as the **Big-O complexity** of an algorithm. It's how we can identify what algorithms will work better given a specific problem that needs solving. 

* Explain that today we will learn about popular algorithms, how to implement them, and how to go about solving a question about them in a technical interview.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Linear Search (5 min) 

* Open the [Searching Sorted List visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) in your browser, perform a linear search function, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We can search for where an element appears in an array by checking each value one at a time.

  * 🔑 When we find that element, we return the index of where it appeared and stop the function.

  * 🔑 If we don't find the element we're looking for, we receive a `-1` back, since there is no `-1` index in a JavaScript array.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to pseudocode it!

* Open `21-Ins_Linear-Search/linear-search.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 During a technical interview, it's always a good idea to spend some time pseudocoding and laying out your thought process before writing code.

  * 🔑 For a linear search algorithm implementation using JavaScript, this is what those steps might look like, but may have more or less depending on the person implementing it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What assumptions can we make about this algorithm's implementation?

  * 🙋 We can assume that the input array will be an array of numbers and has at least one element in it. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Linear-Search/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Linear Search (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Linear-Search/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement Linear Search Algorithm

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a set of data.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the search algorithm function can accept an input array and value to find.

  * It's done when the search algorithm returns the position of the value we are searching for.

  * It's done when the search algorithm returns `-1` to indicate the value is not in the set of data.

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Linear Search (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the linear search algorithm? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Array and element inputs

  * ✔️ Return the index

  * ✔️ Big O(n) complexity

* Open `22-Stu_Linear-Search/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We create a function that accepts the array we're searching in and the element we're searching the array for:

  ```js
  const linearSearch = (array, element) => {};
  ```

  * 🔑 We iterate through the array and check every single element if it matches the one we're searching for and return the index of our matched element:

  ```js
  // Loop the given array.
  for (let index = 0; index < array.length; index++) {
    // Check to see if the index of the given array is equal to the element we are searching for.
    if (array[index] === element) {
      // Exit the search by returning the index of the element.
      return index;
    }
  }
  ```

  * If we don't find a match, the `for` loop ends and we return `-1` to indicate it isn't in this array.

  * 🔑 Since the worse case scenario of this algorithm is that the the loop takes us all the way through the array, it's complexity grows at a 1:1 rate with how big the input array is, giving it a Big O complexity of `O(n)`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some good features of this algorithm?

  * 🙋 It will work on unsorted arrays and has a predictable level of complexity.

  * ☝️ What may be a drawback of this algorithm?

  * 🙋 If we have a very large array to search through, the Big O complexity `O(n)` can become inefficient. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read more about search algorithms, and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Recursion (5 min) 

* Navigate to `23-Ins_Recursion` from the command line, run `node index.js` and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 When we run this file, we get a number countdown printed on the page.

  * 🔑 We could do this with a loop, but we didn't.

* Navigate to `23-Ins_Recursion/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following

  * 🔑 Instead of a loop, we use a recursive function to call itself over and over again until we don't meet a condition we've defined ourselves.

  * 🔑 If we didn't have this condition in place, known as a "base" or "exit" condition, our program would loop indefinitely and cause our program to crash.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some use cases for using recursion over loops?

  * 🙋 Recursion allows us to control when the next iteration happens and is very useful for when we don't exactly know how many times we need the functionality to run. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Recursion/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Recursion (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Recursion/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

### 7. Instructor Review: Recursion (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with recursion? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ We search by position

  * ✔️ No recursion for 0 or 1 positions

  * ✔️ Value is the sum of previous values

* Open `24-Stu_Recursion/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 The function returns the value of a given position in the Fibonacci sequence:

    ```js
    const fibonacci = (position) => {}
    ```

  * 🔑 If the input position is less than `2`, we can assume that the position will be `0` or `1`, which are the actual values of the Fibonacci sequence at that position:

  ```js
  if (position < 2) {
    return position;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We get a value of the Fibonacci sequence by adding the previous two position values in the sequence, so we need to calculate their values with the same function, which will call it again and again until `position` is under `2`: 

  ```js
  return fibonacci(position - 1) + fibonacci(position - 2);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we visualize this algorithm? Is there a specific data structure we can use to model it?

  * 🙋 We can visualize it as a binary tree data structure, with each node spawning two nodes below it, which then spawn two nodes below them, and so on.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read about the [fibonacci sequence](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/fibonacci-sequence.html) and the [MDN docs on recursive functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#Recursion), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Binary Search (5 min) 

* Open the [Searching Sorted List visualizer](https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/Search.html) in your browser, perform a binary search, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Unlike the linear search, a binary search works by checking one value at a time starting in the middle of the data set. 

  * 🔑 We identify if the value we're searching for is greater or less than the middle value and cut out half of the data set when we know the value is in the other half.

  * 🔑 If we don't find the element we're looking for, we receive a `-1` back, since there is no `-1` index in a JavaScript array.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We need to pseudocode it!

* Open `25-Ins_Binary-Search/binary-search.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 During a technical interview, it's always a good idea to spend some time pseudocoding and laying out your thought process before writing code.

  * 🔑 For a binary search algorithm implementation using JavaScript, this is what those steps might look like, but may have more or less depending on the person implementing it.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What assumptions can we make about this algorithm's implementation?

  * 🙋 We can assume that the input array must be sorted for it to work.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Binary-Search/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Binary Search (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Binary-Search/README.md`.

  # 🐛 Binary Search Algorithm Not Passing Tests

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a set of data using a binary search function.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When we run our unit tests to test our binary search function, the defined tests should pass.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When we run our unit tests, the defined tests don't pass.

  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. From the [Unsolved](./Unsolved) directory, run `npm install` in the command line.

  2. Run `npm run test` from the command line to run unit tests.

  3. The tests defined in the `__tests__` directory do not pass.

  ## 💡 Hints

  How can the unit test descriptions help us determine what the function is or isn't doing?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is worst possible Big-O complexity an algorithm can have? What is the best?

### 10. Instructor Review: Binary Search (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with a binary search algorithm? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Adjust start and end positions

  * ✔️ The `while` loop

  * ✔️ Exit conditions

* Open `26-Stu_Binary-Search` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We start by getting the start and end positions, which we will update when we determine what half our value lies in:

  ```js
  let start = 0;
  let end = array.length - 1;
  ```

  * 🔑 We use a `while` loop to continuously run the functionality of getting a middle value, checking if the searched value is greater than, less than, or equal to it, and adjusting the start/end points if we need to:

  ```js
  while (start <= end) {
    let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);

    if (array[mid] === element) {
      // We must return true once we have found the element being searched for.
      return true;
    } else if (array[mid] < element) {
      start = mid + 1;
    } else {
      end = mid - 1;
    }
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We are done running this function when either the middle value is the value we're searching for or we've cut the search array down so much that the end value becomes less than the start value and the `while` loop ends to return `false`.  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the Big O complexity of this algorithm? 

  * 🙋 It has a Big O complexity of `O(log n)` because it effectively cuts its input in half every pass.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Wikipedia entry on binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Shell/README.md`.

### 11. Everyone Do: Shell Scripts (20 min)

* Open your command line environment and demonstrate the following:

  * We've been using this environment throughout the class to perform a number of functions for our computer, Node applications, and Git repositories.

  * This is because our command line is powered by what's known as a "shell", which has programming language of its own we can use to help perform complex tasks and provide automation in our workflow. 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Shell/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open `27-Evr_Shell/Solved/git-file-cleanup.sh` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We can write our own commands to be executed as programs across our computers, we just begin the file with a shebang interpreter directive:

  ```sh
  #!/bin/bash
  ```

  * 🔑 We can store variables and recall upon them whenever we want, including the storing of Git commands to be executed from within our program:

  ```sh
  TO_REMOVE=`git clean -f -d -n`;
  ```

  * A lot of Git commands that affect the repository have what's known as a "dry run" `-n` option to show what _would_ happen without actually doing it.

  * 🔑 These commands can be set up for execution anywhere in our `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` files as "aliases":

  ```sh
  # in a run command file...
  alias gfc="~/<path>/<to>/git-file-cleanup.sh"
  ```

  * Congratulations on taking a moment to quickly learn a new programming language! 

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

### 12. BREAK (40 min)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini Project (5 min) 

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 Technical interviews are intimidating for even the most experienced developers, so it's good to practice either with others or yourself to build confidence in yourself before the interview.

  * 🔑 The questions asked during an interview are sometimes purposely ambiguous and will require the job candidate to follow up with some questions or assumptions. This gives the interviewer an idea of how the candidate approaches a problem, even if they do not know the solution.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What happens if we don't know the answer to a question asked?

  * 🙋 When in an interview, be honest about it and work your way through it anyway. In this environment, work together to come to a solution.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini Project (60 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Mini-Project: Technical Interview Practice (Sorting Algorithms)

  In this mini-project, you and a partner will simulate a technical interview by taking turns as the interviewer and job candidate. 

  ## Roles

  * **The Interviewer**: The role of the interviewer is to pose the question, ensure the candidate understands what is expected of them throughout their time coming to a solution, and clarifies any questions a candidate may have without giving away the answer. 

  * **The Candidate**: The role of the candidate is to ensure the problem stated by the interviewer is clear by asking clarifying questions and stating assumptions, pseudocoding a solution, and then implementing it (if time allows).

  ## Instructions

  * Take turns playing each role and go through each interview question. 

  * Spend about 20 minutes on each, allowing time for research of the problem, pseudocoding the solution, implementing the solution, and discussion throughout for clarification.

  * The interviewer can use the prompts and solutions laid out for each question in the [Main](./Main) directory.

  * The candidate can use the prompts, notes, and workspace for each question in the [Develop](./Develop) directory.

  * During each question, allow the candidate to do some research on the question using Google to help outline a solution. The interviewer can spend that time reviewing the solution code and come up with prompts to support the candidate.

  * Take this seriously, but don't put too much pressure on yourself to come to an answer! The idea is to be conversational about these questions to help both of you come to a solution that you can understand and explain in an interview setting.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini Project  (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Sorting algorithms

  * ✔️ The Interviewer

  * ✔️ The Candidate

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/01_bubble-sort/bubble-sort.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 A bubble sort function can be implemented in a couple of ways. One way involves sorting the array one index at a time, the other will iterate the entire array multiple times and sort elements gradually until it doesn't need to sort anymore. The second way is slightly more efficient because we build in a base condition to end early if the array is sorted:

    ```js
    while (!sorted) {
      sorted = true;
      for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        if (array[i] > array[i + 1]) {
          const tmp = array[i];

          array[i] = array[i + 1];

          array[i + 1] = tmp;

          sorted = false;
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 The interviewer will likely want the candidate to be able to articulate the differences between the two implementations and why one may be more efficient than the other.

  * 🔑 The candidate should be able to articulate the need for a temporary variable to hold an element being swapped and how a flag can be set to determine if the array has been sorted yet or not. 

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/02_quick-sort/quick-sort.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 A quick sort algorithm works by recursively splitting an array in two based on greater than or less than values compared to a pivot element until there are numerous arrays in order that can be concatenated back together and returned in a sorted fashion:

    ```js
    const quickSort = (array) => {
      if (array.length <= 1) {
        return array;
      }

      const pivot = array.splice(Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length), 1);

      const left = [];
      const right = [];

      array.forEach((el) => {
        if (el <= pivot) {
          left.push(el);
        } else {
          right.push(el);
        }
      });

      return quickSort(left).concat(pivot, quickSort(right));
    };

  * 🔑 The interviewer may ask this question to see if the candidate has a good understanding of recursion.

  * 🔑 The candidate should be able to visualize the recursive nature of this type of algorithm and be able to explain why the selection of a random pivot point works for this type of algorithm. 

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/03_merge-sort/merge-sort.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 A merge sort algorithm involves using recursion to continuously break apart an array until we're left with a series of single-element arrays:

    ```js
    const mergeSort = (array) => {
      if (array.length <= 1) {
        return array;
      }

      const middle = Math.floor(array.length / 2);

      const left = array.slice(0, middle);
      const right = array.slice(middle);

      return mergeArrays(mergeSort(left), mergeSort(right));
    };
    ```

  * All of these arrays are then compared to one another and used to build a new array that's sorted and eventually returned:

  ```js
  const mergeArrays = (leftArray, rightArray) => {
    const resultArray = [];

    let leftIndex = 0;
    let rightIndex = 0;

      if (leftArray[leftIndex] < rightArray[rightIndex]) {
        resultArray.push(leftArray[leftIndex]);
        leftIndex++;
      } else {
        resultArray.push(rightArray[rightIndex]);
        rightIndex++;
      }
    }

    return resultArray
      .concat(leftArray.slice(leftIndex))
      .concat(rightArray.slice(rightIndex));
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 This is a difficult interview question, so the interviewer may ask this when they are confident in the previous answers a candidate has provided. Since it's a bit longer to implement in code, the interviewer will likely want to ensure the candidate can accurately describe a solution in pseudocode first so time isn't lost. 

  * 🔑 The candidate should be able to again visualize the recursive nature of this algorithm and explain that rather than trying to sort a large set of data, we break our data into smaller sets and iteratively sort them back together.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we prepare ourselves for questions like this on an interview?

  * 🙋 We can practice and not be discouraged if we can't always get to an answer!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, conduct more interview practice amongst ourselves, and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Homework (5 min)

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * @TODO { WHAT ARE WE GOING TO BE BUILD? }

  * @TODO { ISN'T THIS NEAT! A SOPHISTICATED OR MODERN APPLICATION OF A KEY TOPIC. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WHAT? }.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 @TODO {YES, WHAT? }.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 @TODO { HOW DO COMPANIES USE IT IN INTERESTING WAYS? HOW POPULAR OR IN-DEMAND IS IT? WHY IS THE PROJECT ENTICING TO EMPLOYERS? }

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Homework Requirements found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
