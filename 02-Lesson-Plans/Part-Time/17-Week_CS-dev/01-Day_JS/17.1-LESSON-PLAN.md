# 17.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: JavaScript Execution

## Overview 

In today's class, students will be re-introduced to JavaScript. They will breakdown how JavaScript executes an application so they can understand how the different components work together to run a program. Students will use the browser to understand the role of Web APIs and asynchronous behavior.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Global-Execution-Context` through `10-Stu_Callback-Queues`.

* You will be using `jest` to test some of the activities. Be sure to familiarize yourself with the tests.

* TLDR: Students may need some time to adjust back into a testing environment. Interpreting the test descriptions and error messages are key parts in solving some of the activities.

* The first activity, `01-Ins_Global-Execution-Context`, steps through the execution process of JavaScript in the browser. This is an effort to peak behind the curtain to see which components of JavaScript are used to execute different parts of a program.

* Students may get hung up over the difference between scope and context. Scope refers to the accessibility of variables. Context refers to the object to which the function belongs. [Scope vs Context](https://blog.kevinchisholm.com/javascript/difference-between-scope-and-context/)

* Activities `04-Stu_Functional-Execution-Context` through `08-Stu_Queues` have test suites. Much of the instruction on how to pass the tests will be described in each unit test. The tests are not to be modified. Each of these are Node activities, so you will need to `npm install` before running the tests. A `jest --watch` script has been used to simplify re-running tests.

* The last activity of the day, `10-Stu_Callback-Queues`, uses a while loop to create a blocking process, making the page unresponsive and slow to load. Students may need to refresh their browsers or select the Block button to demonstrate the blocking effect. The point of this activity is to delay this blocking process so the page can render quickly to improve the UX.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the difference between a global execution context and a function execution context.

* Identify when a function execution context is created and what is stored in it.

* Describe the functions of the call stack and the callback queue.

* Compare and contrast a stack vs a queue in terms of LIFO and FIFO.

* Summarize asynchronous behavior and the role of the event loop.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã @TODO { HOW DO COMPANIES USE IT IN INTERESTING WAYS? HOW POPULAR OR IN-DEMAND IS IT? WHY IS THE PROJECT ENTICING TO EMPLOYERS? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity. -->

### 2. Instructor Demo: Global Execution Context (5 min) 

* Open `01-Ins_Global-Execution-Context/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When the program runs, the `main()` program is placed onto the call stack and a global execution context is created.

  * üîë Follow the comment prompts, following the thread of execution in sequence, describing how each statement is processed.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is a Web API?

  * üôã A library of methods and properties located on the `window` object which is associated with the browser.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Global-Execution-Context/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Global Execution Context (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Global-Execution-Context/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìê Add Comments to the Code Execution Process

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved](./Unsolved).

## üìù Note(s)

Refer to the documentation: 

* [The event loop.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop)

* Due to the visual quality of this exercise, it may be helpful to sketch the execution context and the allocation of variables.

---

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is the scope chain? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review:  Global Execution Context (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `execution context`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è call stack & callback queue

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Web APIs

  * ‚úîÔ∏è execution context

* Open `02-Stu_Global-Execution-Context/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  1.  Where is carNoise stored?
  The variable `carNoise` is stored in the global execution context and is assigned the value 'Honk'.

  2. Where is goFast stored?
  
  * The function definition `goFast` is also stored in the global execution context and is assigned the function definition.

  3. üîë What happens in the statement, `if(confirm("Do you want to go fast?"))`?
  
  * The conditional statement based on the evaluation of the `confirm()` to execute `goFast()`.  Since `confirm()` is a Web API, once it has resolved, the function `goFast()` is then placed on the callback queue and then the call stack so it can be executed.

  4.  When is `speed` assigned a value? Where is this value stored?
  
  * When `goFast()` is invoked, the argument of the function is assigned to the parameter, `speed`, in the functional execution context of `goFast`.

  5.  Where is `makeNoise` stored? 

  * `makeNoise` is stored in the function execution context of `goFast`

  6. What happens in this statement,  `makeNoise(carNoise)`?
  
  * Invoking `makeNoise()` places the function on the call stack. Once executed, a new execution context is created

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens to the functional execution context once a function has executed?

  * üôã Once the function has completed execution, the functional execution context is destroyed, no longer storing the associated local variables or function definitions.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are some of the benefits of having variables that are locally scoped?

  * üôã Enables duplicate variable names without conflict in an application, privatization of variables, abstraction of code, and reduces pollution of the global namespace.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?
  
  * We can refer to supplemental material, read [MDN's documentation regarding the keyword `this`, global context, and function context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Functional Execution Context (5 min) 

* Open `03-Ins_Functional-Execution-Context/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Keyword `this` in the global execution context refers to the `window` in the browser.
  
  * üîë In a functional execution context, the value of `this` depends on how the function was called.

* Open `03-Ins_Functional-Execution-Context/index.html` in your browser, open the console, and demonstrate the following:

  * When calling a method of an object, `this` refers to the object it was called from.
  
  * üîë Functional execution context includes a reference to how the function was called to assign `this`.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens to `this` if we refactor `myFuncB` to use an arrow function?

  * üôã `this` retains the reference to `window`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is this important to know?

  * üôã Questions regarding `this` are popular technical interview questions.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens to the value of `this` in `myFuncA` if we add `use strict`?

  * üôã `this` becomes `undefined` in the `myFuncA` since it was not assigned.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Functional-Execution-Context/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Functional Execution Context (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Functional-Execution-Context/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üêõ The tests fail due to ReferenceError

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* The unit tests for the function do not pass.

## Expected Behavior

* When we run the unit test, the defined test should pass.

## Actual Behavior

* When we run our unit tests, the defined tests don't pass.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. From the [Unsolved](./Unsolved) directory, run `npm install` in the command line.

2. Run `npm run test` from the command line to run the unit test.

3. The tests defined in the `__tests__` directory does not pass.

---

## üí° Hint(s)

* How can the unit test descriptions help us determine what the function is or isn't doing?

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What does the keyword `this` reference in Node.js for the global context?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Functional Execution Context (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `Functional Execution Context`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è functional execution context lifecycle

  * ‚úîÔ∏è return statement

  * ‚úîÔ∏è private variables

* Open `04-Stu_Functional-Execution-Context/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë The variables, `total` and `i`, declared in the inner function, `sum()`. Therefore neither variable can be accessed in the scope of the outer function, `arg()` and can be considered private variables.
  
  *  This was the cause of the error which failed the tests. 

  ```js
  function sum() {
    let total = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      total += array[i];
    }
  }
  ```

  * üîë By adding the statement, `return total`, to the inner function, `sum()`, we explicitly end the function's execution, remove the function execution context, pop `sum()` off the call stack, and assign the value of `total` to the where `sum()` was called.

  ```js
  function sum() {
    let total = 0;
    for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
      total += array[i];
    }

    return total;
  }
  ```
  
  * Calling `sum()` in the outer function executes the inner function which returns the sum of the numbers in the array. 

  ```js
  function avg(array) {
    function sum() {
      let total = 0;
      for(let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        total += array[i];
      }
      // total is accessible in the sum()'s execution context
      return total;
    }
    // value of total is returned to where sum() is invoked
    return sum()/array.length;
  }
  ```

  * Navigate to `04-Stu_Functional-Execution-Context/Solved` in the terminal and execute the following commands:
  
  ```bash
  npm install; npm run test;
  ```

  * Demonstrate that all the tests are passing.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why would we want to have private variables?

  * üôã Allows variables to have duplicate names without conflicts in a program, eliminates accidental data modifications due to pollution of the global namespace, abstracts logic to single concerns, and adds security by eliminating availability to variables.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens to the functional execution context of a function once that function has finished executing?

  * üôã The functional execution context of a function is destroyed once the function finishes executing.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs for function context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#Function_context), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Stacks (5 min) 

* Navigate to `05-Ins_Stacks` in your terminal and execute the following command:

```bash
npm install; npm run test;
```

* Open `05-Ins_Stacks/__tests__/index.test.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:
  
  * The test descriptions give you clues on how to implement a stack, a type of data structure:
    
    * `container` is the name of the initialized variable. What is the data type?

    * The names and functions are of both methods. 

  * The third test description tells us we can add an item to the back of the array.

  * The fourth test description tells us we can remove an item from the back of the array.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Does anyone know why a stack's operations are considered last in first out or LIFO?

  * üôã The latest item to be added to a stack is also first one to be removed. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why are we learning this?

  * üôã Data structures store data and are fundamental components in computer science. Data structures commonly appear on technical interview questions so understanding the basic ones such as a stack is important.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Stacks/Unsolved/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Stacks (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Stacks/Unsolved/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
