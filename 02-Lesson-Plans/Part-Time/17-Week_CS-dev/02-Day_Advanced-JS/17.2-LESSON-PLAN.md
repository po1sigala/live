# 17.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Computer Science For JavaScript

## Overview 

In today's class, students will be taking a dive deep into what JavaScript does under the hood. Students will get to see how higher order functions work and how we can implement them into our code. Next, students will get to see the fascinating behavior of closures. Along with learning about closures, they will learn how to leverage them with factory functions. Students will learn about the difference between inheritance and a composition based approach when designing an application. Finally, students will learn a new way to delegate events using closures.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `11-Ins_Higher-Order-Functions` through `20-Stu_Event-Delegation-Handling`.

* This section deals with a few abstract topics, it's important to keep dialog open so students can better grasp these topics.

* Closures are a huge chunk of the day's activities. If you are feeling a little unsure about them, take a moment to get more familiar with them.

* In `13-Ins_Closures` we use `console.dir`, encourage students to learn about it on their own time but we will only be using for demonstration purposes.

* The `17-Ins_Factory-Vs-Constructor` demo may take longer than five minutes but the prior and following activities should take less time. It is more important to talk about the code over live coding the demo for this particular activity.

* We will be using jest in a couple of the activities so make sure students use `npm test` when prompted.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Construct their own higher order functions.

* Explain the lexical environment.

* Identify encapsulated variables.

* Create a factory function.

* Distinguish the difference between inheritance and composition design.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òù What is a paradigm in programming?
  
  * üôã It's a style and/or philosophy that a programming language follows.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is object oriented programming?

  * üôã It is a programming paradigm that JavaScript uses. We model our data around objects.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What other paradigms does JavaScript utilize?

  * üôã Functional and procedural.

* Explain that we will be learning about the technical portion of the interview process. With a focus on the functional paradigm of JavaScript.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è In JavaScript, how else can we create objects?

  * üôã With classes and constructor functions.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are some problems that may occur when using class inheritance?

  * üôã It can be difficult to restructure our class hierarchy the larger our app becomes.
  
* Explain to students that we will be learning an entirely new way to build our own objects using factory functions.

* Reassure the students that these topics can get abstract and be sure to ask questions.

* JavaScript has many layers and interviewers want to know how well a candidate understands them. 

* In JavaScript we have a design choice to make early on that will dictate if we use inheritance or composition.

* JavaScript uses three different paradigms and it is important as developer we understand each one and how to leverage them to our benefit.

* Let students know this knowledge comes with time and practice and not to fall into that sinking feeling of imposter syndrome.

* They have been using these concepts all along and now we are just expanding on that knowledge.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Higher Order Functions (5 min) 

* Open `11-Ins_Higher-Order-Functions/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We first create a function that we will be using to pass into the JavaScript provided higher order function, `.map()`.

  * We have access to the element and the index of the element which is provided to us through the `.map()` method.

  ```js
  function evenIndexMultiplier(number, index) {
    // Code...
  }
  ```
  
  * Next, we create the logic for our function that will be passed into our higher order function, the `.map()` method.

  ```js
  function evenIndexMultiplier(number, index) {
    
    if (index % 2 === 0) {
    
      return number * 10;

    }

    return number;
  }
  ```

  * üîë Finally, we pass our newly created function into the `.map()` method and storing it into a variable named `evenIndexes`.
  
  * üîë Now we have a function which accepts another function as an argument, creating a higher order function.

  * üîë We are not limited to only using `evenIndexMultiplier` inside the `.map()` method. We can use `evenIndexMultiplier` anywhere in our application or even in a custom higher order function.

  ```js
  const evenIndexes = arrayIndex.map(evenIndexMultiplier);

  ```

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * As we can see every even index is being multiplied by ten which is exactly what our function was meant to do.

  ```
  [10, 52, 350, 6, 720, 7, 30, 19, 320, 54, 780, 95, 970]
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use higher order functions to our benefit?

  * üôã It makes our code more reusable.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Are we limited to using a higher order function provided by JavaScript?

  * üôã No, we can create our own. The function just needs to be able to accept another function for an argument.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Higher-Order-Functions/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Higher Order Functions (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Higher-Order-Functions/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üèóÔ∏è Create a function to pass into the reducer method that finds the average of an array of numbers

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a teacher, I want to be able to find the average grade of my entire class.

* As a developer, I want to be able to reuse my `findAverage` function in multiple filter method calls throughout my application so that my code is not being duplicated unnecessarily.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `findAverage` function correctly calculates the average of an array of numbers.

* It's done when the `findAverage` function is being correctly passed through the reduce method.

## üí° Hints

How do you find out how many elements are in an array? 

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other built-in functions are also higher order functions? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Higher Order Functions (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with higher order functions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Accepting another function as an argument

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `.reduce()`

* Open `12-Stu_Higher-Order-Functions/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We create a function named `findAverage` that has access to four arguments `accumulator`, `currentValue`, `index`, and `array`.

  * üîë We have access to these arguments because they are provided to us through the `.reduce()` method.

  ```js
  function findAverage(accumulator, currentValue, index, array) {
    // Code...
  }
  ```

  * Check to see if we are at the final index of the given array.

  * If so, we return our total plus the current value and divide it by how many elements are in the array. 
  
  ```js
  function findAverage(accumulator, currentValue, index, array) {
    
    if (index === array.length - 1) {
    
    return (accumulator + currentValue) / array.length;
    }
  }
  ```
    
  * If we have not reached the end of the array, add the total to the current value we are on. 
  
  ```js
  function findAverage(accumulator, currentValue, index, array) {
    
    if (index === array.length - 1) {
    
      return (accumulator + currentValue) / array.length;
    }

  
    return accumulator + currentValue;
  }
  ```
  
  * üîë Pass our newly created `findAverage` function into the `.reduce()` method.

  ```js
  let gradeAverage = grades.reduce(findAverage);
  ```

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Inside of the `console` we should see the correct average being displayed.

  ```
  [79.5]
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are some other JavaScript methods that are higher order functions?

  * üôã `.filter()` `.forEach()`

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Closures (5 min) 

* Open `13-Ins_Closures/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We first create a function named `bankAccount`, which will be the outer function and create a closure around our soon-to-exist inner function:

  ```js
  function bankAccount() {
    // Code...
  }
  ```

  * Now we create two variables inside of our outer function which will be scoped to the inner function we will be creating.

  ```js
  function bankAccount() {
    
    const checking = 400;

    const savings = 1000;
  }
  ```
  
  * üîë In order to use a closure our function must return an object with some type functionality, whether it be one method or multiple.

  ```js
  function bankAccount() {
    
    const checking = 400;

    const savings = 1000;

    return {
      displayFunds: function () {

        // Code...
      
      },
    };
  }
  ```

  * Inside of the object being returned, we create a `displayFunds` method that logs the `checking` and `savings` variables.
  ```js
  function bankAccount() {
    
    const checking = 400;

    const savings = 1000;

    return {

      displayFunds: function () {

        console.log(
          `You have $${checking} in your checking account and $${savings} in your savings account`
        );

      },
    };
  }
  ```

  * Let's store our `bankAccount` function inside of a variable and test what happens when we call our `displayFunds()` method.

  ```js
  const myBank = bankAccount();

  myBank.displayFunds()
  ```

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and explain the following:
  
  * üîë In the console we can see the `displayFunds()` method has access to the `bankAccount()` function's lexical environment. 

    ```
    You have $400 in your checking account and $1000 in your savings account
    ```

  * The next statement we will see is from `console.dir`. Feel free to look up what `console.dir` does but we are only using it for demonstration purposes.

  ```js
  console.dir(myBank)
  ```

  * üîë By doing this we can inspect the scope of our `displayFunds()` method and see that it does have a closure with a reference to the two variables in the outer functions lexical environment.

  * Something else that is interesting, is our function is also an object.

  ```
  Object
    displayFunds: ∆í ()
      arguments: null
      caller: null
      length: 0
      name: "displayFunds"
      prototype: {constructor: ∆í}
      __proto__: ∆í ()
      [[FunctionLocation]]: Closures.js:24
      [[Scopes]]: Scopes[3]
        0: Closure (bankAccount)
          checking: 400
          savings: 1000
        1: Script {myBank: {‚Ä¶}}
        2: Global {window: Window, self: Window, document: document, name: "", location: Location, ‚Ä¶}
    __proto__: Object
  ```

  * üîë For the final two statements, we can see that the variable inside of the `bankAccount()` function are not accessible from outside the functions lexical environment.

  ```
  undefined
  undefined
  ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Can we access a function's variable from outside of its scope?

  * üôã No, we have to be inside of its lexical environment.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we use a closure?

  * üôã Returning an inner function which has access to the outer function's lexical environment.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Closures/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Closures (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Closures/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üèóÔ∏è Create a counter function that uses a private variable

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a teacher, I want a way to keep track of the number of students I see every day.

* As a developer, I want to keep my `count` variable data private.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `Counter` function correctly increments by one.

* It's done when I can only access the `count` variable from within the `Counter` function.

* It's done when all of the unit tests pass with `npm test`.

## üí° Hints

When is a closure created? 

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the lexical environment? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Closures (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with closures? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Closures

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Private variables

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Lexical environment

* Open `14-Stu_Closures/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë By creating the function `counter`, we have also created a closure.

  ```js
  function counter() {
    // Code...
  }
  ```
 
  * üîë Inside of our outer function we create a private `count` variable which will hold how many times our function is called.

  ```js
  function counter() {

    let count = 0;
  }
  ```

  * üîë Next, we utilize the closure by returning an object with the `increment` method which increases the `count` by one.

  ```js
  function counter() {
    
    let count = 0;

    return {

      increment: function () {
        
        return count++;
      },
    };
  }
  ```

  * If we type `npm test` in the command line we should see:

  ```bash
    PASS  __tests__/index.test.js
    ‚àö counter is a defined function (2 ms)
    ‚àö counter is returning as an object
    ‚àö count should equal 0 (1 ms)
    ‚àö count should equal 1
    ‚àö count should equal 4

  Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
  Tests:       5 passed, 5 total
  Snapshots:   0 total
  Time:        1.974 s
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How else could we use closures?

  * üôã We could conceal sensitive variables that shouldn't be mutated outside of its function's scope.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Factory Functions (5 min) 

* Open `15-Ins_Factory-Functions/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We create a function that accepts three arguments, `name`, `age`, and `city`.

  ```js
  function createUser(name, age, city) {
    // Code...
  }
  ```

  * Factory functions are similar to JavaScript classes.

  * üîë Instead of using a `constructor()` and binding our arguments to `this`, we create an object inside of our function that holds our arguments.

  * üîë Since we don't have a `constructor()` function, `this` refers to the parent object.

  ```js
  function createUser(name, age, city) {

    let user = {
      name: name,
      age: age,
      city: city
    }

  }
  ```

  * üîë Factory functions use closures to encapsulate its variables, making it difficult to mutate the data from outside of its function scope.

  * For us to leverage closures we need to return an object with a method inside of it. We return two, `introduceSelf()` and `location()`.

  ```js
  function createUser(name, age, city) {

    let user = {
      name: name,
      age: age,
      city: city
    }

      return {

        introduceSelf: function() {
            // Code...
        },

        location: function() {
            // Code...
        }
    }
  }
  ```

  * Inside of both our methods we `console.log` our user using the object we created with dot notation instead of `this`.

  ```js
  function createUser(name, age, city) {

    let user = {
      name: name,
      age: age,
      city: city
    }

      return {

        introduceSelf: function() {
            
          return console.log(`Hi my name is ${user.name} and I am currently ${user.age} years old!`)
        },

        location: function() {

          return console.log(`${user.name} is located in ${user.city}`)
        }
    }
  }

  ```

  * üîë Similar to JavaScript classes but we no longer need the `new` keyword, use our `createUser` factory function to create an user.

  ```js
  const userOne = createUser('Beverly', 58, 'Phoenix')
  ```

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following:
  
  * As we can see the new user we created works as expected, without using a JavaScript class.

  * üîë The new user has a reference to our `createUser` function which has the data we want encapsulated in it.

  * All this is done with closures.

    ```
    Hi my name is Beverly and I am currently 58 years old!
    Beverly is located in Phoenix
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Inside of a factory function what does `this` refer too?

  * üôã The parent object.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Do we need to use the `new` keyword with factory functions?

  * üôã No, we can forgo it entirely. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Factory-Functions/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Factory Functions (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Factory-Functions/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üêõ Factory function is returning undefined values when the inner function is called

  Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

  * As a developer, I want the inner function of my factory function to correctly log the variables when called.

  ## Expected Behavior

  When a user calls the `greet` method on the `Student` function, the values should be correctly displayed in the console.

  ## Actual Behavior

  When a user calls the `greet` method on the `Student` function, they see undefined values instead of the `name` and `gradeYear`.
  
  ## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

  1. Create a new student variable and assign it to the `Student` function. 

  2. Call the `greet` method on the newly created student variable.

  3. Check console to see undefined values.

  4. Run `npm test` to check if all unit test pass.

  ## üí° Hints

  What is the context of `this` when inside of a factory function? 

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Is the `new` keyword required when using a factory function? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Factory Functions (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with factory functions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Factory functions

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `new`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `this`

* Open `16-Stu_Factory-Functions/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We create a new function and store its two arguments `name` and `gradeYear` inside of a newly created object named `student`.

  ```js
  function Student(name, gradeYear) {
    
    let student = {
      name: name,
      gradeYear: gradeYear,
    };

  }
  ```

  * Remember, `this` is being bound to the parent object instead of the new one being created.

  * üîë If we want to access the `name` and `gradeYear` we must use the student object we stored it in.

  ```js
  function Student(name, gradeYear) {
    
    let student = {
      name: name,
      gradeYear: gradeYear,
    };

    return {
      
      greet: function () {

        console.log(
          `My name is ${student.name} and I am in ${student.gradeYear} grade`
        );

      },
    };
  }
  ```

  * üîë Now, we create a new student with our `Student` factory function without the use of the `new` keyword.

  ```js
  const newStudent = Student('Dominique', '11th');
  ```
    
  * If we type `npm test` in the command line we should see:

  ```bash
  Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
  Tests:       4 passed, 4 total
  Snapshots:   0 total
  Time:        1.924 s
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Do we use a `constructor()` function inside of a factory function?

  * üôã No.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Factory VS Constructor (5 min) 

* Open `17-Ins_Factory-Vs-Constructor/constructor.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We are going to take a step back and look at how we have been creating classes in JavaScript so far.

  * In this application we are going to have a simple `Device` class and a `Phone` class that `extends` off of our `Device`.

  ```js
  class Device {
      constructor(name){
          this.name = name
      }

      takePicture() {
          console.log(`Taking picture with ${this.name}`)
      }
  }

  class Phone extends Device {
      constructor(name, ringTone) {
          super(name) 
          this.ringTone = ringTone
      }

      call() {
          console.log(`Phone: ${this.ringTone}`)
      }
  }
  ```

  * Now we have a basic class tree. The `Phone` can `call` and inherits the `takePicture` method from the `Device` class.

  ```js
  const nokia = new Phone('Nokia', 'ring')
  nokia.call()
  nokia.takePicture()
  console.log(nokia)
  ```

  * If we run this in Node we can see that it is working like we expected.

  ```
  Phone: ring
  Taking picture with Nokia
  ```

  * Lets have a quick refresher on how the prototype chain works with classes by inspecting the `nokia` variable we created.

  * üîë By looking at the `__proto__` object we can see the reference to our `Device` which holds the `takePicture` method that our `Phone` class inherits.

  ```
  Phone {name: "Nokia", ringTone: "ring"}
    name: "Nokia"
    ringTone: "ring"
    __proto__: Device
      call: ∆í call()
      constructor: class Phone
      __proto__:
        constructor: class Device
        takePicture: ∆í takePicture()
        __proto__: Object
  ```

  * In this application we create two more classes, `Appliance` and `Dryer` that `extends` of it.

  * Like earlier, they each have a method and some type of data stored.

  ```js
  class Appliance {
      constructor(noise){
          this.noise = noise
      }

      makeNoise() {
          console.log(this.noise)
      }
  }

  class Dryer extends Appliance {
      constructor(noise) {
          super(noise)

      }

      dry() {
          console.log(`Dryer is on: ${this.noise}`);
      }
  }

    ``` 

  * The `Phone` class inherits from the `Device` class and the `Dryer` class inherits from the `Appliance` class.
  
  * With the current class hierarchy it would be difficult to create an `Appliance` that could make a `call` without rewriting the `call` method.

  * üîë Having to rewrite logic does not practice the DRY principle of programming. Don't Repeat Yourself.

  * üîë This can get quickly out of control if we decide to make more changes similar to this one.

* Open `17-Ins_Factory-Vs-Constructor/factory-functions.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * Lets look at how we can take a composition based approach with factory functions.

  * üîë We create factory functions that accept `state` as an argument and return a method which uses the information provided through the `state`.

  * We can think of state has an object that stores information that our function needs.
    
  ```js
  const phoneCall = (state) => ({
    call: () => console.log(`${state.name}'s Phone: ${state.ringTone}`),
  });

  const makeNoise = (state) => ({
    noise: () => console.log(state.noise),
  });

  const drying = (state) => ({
    dry: () =>
      console.log(`Finish drying in ${state.timer} minutes. ${state.noise}`),
  });

  ```

  * üîë Create a function named `Phone` which receives the `name` and `ringTone` that we will store in an object named `state`.

  ```js
  const Phone = (name, ringTone) => {
    
    const state = {
      name,
      ringTone
    };
  };
  ```

  * üîë Lets return an object and with `...` operator and our action function passing in the `state` to it.

  ```js
  const Phone = (name, ringTone) => {
    
    const state = {
      name,
      ringTone
    };

    return { ...phoneCall(state) };
  };
  ```

  * Using the same logic we are going to create a `Dryer` and `Washer` factory functions.

  ```js
  const Dryer = (noise, timer) => {

    const state = {
      noise,
      timer
    };

    return { ...makeNoise(state), ...drying(state) };
  };

  const Washer = (name, noise, ringTone) => {

    const state = {
      name,
      noise,
      ringTone
    };

    return { ...makeNoise(state), ...phoneCall(state) };
  };
  ```

  * Lets test out our new factory functions to see if it works as expected.

  ```js
  // No need to add the `new` keyword because we are using a factory function.
  const nokia = Phone('Nokia', 'ring');
  const decker = Dryer('brshhuhsh', 35);
  const wPool = Washer('Whirlpool', 'brshhh', 'ring ring from the washer');
  // Test if our action functions work correctly with our newly created phone.
  nokia.call();
  decker.noise();
  decker.dry();
  wPool.call();
  wPool.noise();
  ```

  * If we run this in node we can see that it is working like we expected.

  * üîë With inheritance we design our types based what they are. With composition we design our types on what they do.

  ```
  Nokia's Phone: ring
  brshhuhsh
  Finish drying in 35 minutes. brshhuhsh
  Whirlpool's Phone: ring ring from the washer
  brshhh
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens if we want to make an appliance that can make a phone call??

  * üôã We would have to make a new `call` method on the `Appliance`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between inheritance and composition design?

  * üôã Inheritance is based on what types are. Composition is based on what types do.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_Factory-Vs-Constructor/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: Factory VS Constructor (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_Factory-Vs-Constructor/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üèóÔ∏è Refactor the `Lesson` class to a factory function

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to move away from a inheritance based approach and start to use a composition based approach so that my application's tree hierarchy is less rigid.

* As a teacher, I want to be able to add a new lesson with a title and description to my collection of lessons I can teach.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `Lesson` class is a factory function in order to make my application less rigid in case we decide to add new features.

* It's done when I can call the `information` method on the `Lesson` function and it correctly logs the private variable.

## üí° Hints

What scope does your inner function have access too? 

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the three paradigms of JavaScript? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 14. Instructor Review: Factory VS Constructor (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with factory functions vs constructor functions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Inheritance

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Composition

* Open `18-Stu_Factory-Vs-Constructor/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * Create a function named `lesson` and two variables named `title` and `description`inside of an object labeled `state`.

  ```js
  const lesson = function () {  
    const state = {
      title: 'Unit 17 - Computer Science',
      description: 'CS for JS',
    };

  };
  ```

  * üîë Instead of creating a method, we are going to create a function named `getInformation` which accepts our `state` as an argument.

  * We will return an inner function which logs the `title` and `description`.

  ```js
  const getInformation = (state) => ({
    information: () => console.log(state.title, state.description),
  });
  ```

  * Inside of our `lesson` function, we must return our action function `getInformation` passing in the `state` object.

  ```js
  const lesson = function () {  
    const state = {
      title: 'Unit 17 - Computer Science',
      description: 'CS for JS',
    };

    return { ...getInformation(state) };
  };
  ```

  * üîë No need to use the `new` keyword with a factory function.

  ```js
  const csForJS = lesson();
  csForJS.information();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Do factory functions use the `extends` keyword?

  * üôã No, they don't rely on inheritance.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Composition over inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composition_over_inheritance), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Event Delegation and Handling (5 min) 

* Open `19-Ins_Event-Delegation-Handling/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  *  We should see five buttons, each having the label `clicks` followed by a number keeping track of how many times we click.

  *  If we click on a button we should see its respected value increase.

  *  Each button should track its own value.

* Open `19-Ins_Event-Delegation-Handling/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë Inside of our HTML document we can see five `<button>` elements inside of a `<div>` element with the `id="container"`.

  * Each button has its own `data-count` attribute.

  ```html
    <body>
      <div id="container" style="margin: 5px;">
        <button class="btn btn-lg" data-count="0">Clicks: 0</button>
        <button class="btn btn-lg" data-count="0">Clicks: 0</button>
        <button class="btn btn-lg" data-count="0">Clicks: 0</button>
        <button class="btn btn-lg" data-count="0">Clicks: 0</button>
        <button class="btn btn-lg" data-count="0">Clicks: 0</button>
      </div>
  <script src="assets/js/script.js"></script>
  </body>
  ```

* Open `19-Ins_Event-Delegation-Handling/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * First we want to select the `container` our five buttons are being housed in.

  * üîë Remember with event delegation that the event listener is attached the parent element.

  * When a child element is clicked the event will bubble up the DOM until it reaches the event listener.

  ```js
  const containerEl = document.getElementById('container');
  ```

  *  Lets create a function which accepts an `event` for an argument.

  *  Next we parse the `data-count` attribute into a number and store it in a `count` variable.

  ```js
  const clickHandler = function(event) {
    let count = parseInt(event.target.getAttribute('data-count'));
  }
  ```

  *  We create an `if...` statement which increases the `count` variable by one if the `button` element has been clicked.

  *  Finally, we update `data-count` attribute and the display so the correct value is being shown.

  ```js
  const clickHandler = function(event) {

    let count = parseInt(event.target.getAttribute('data-count'));

    if (event.target.matches('button')) {
      
      count++;
      
      event.target.setAttribute('data-count', count);

      event.target.textContent = `Clicks: ${count}`;
    }
  }
  ```

  * üîë The last thing we need to do is add our event listener to the container that holds our buttons.

    ```js
    containerEl.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How could we implement a closure to this event handler?

  * üôã We could encapsulate our `count` variable. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_Event-Delegation-Handling/README.md`.

### 16. Student Do: Event Delegation and Handling (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_Event-Delegation-Handling/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìê Add Comments to Implementation of using closures for event delegation

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js).

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs on closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

* What is a practical use for closures?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Why is keeping the global namespace clean from too many variables important? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: Event Delegation and Handling (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with event handling and delegation using closures? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Event delegation

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Closures

* Open `20-Stu_Event-Delegation-Handling/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë Create a variable which holds our `button` element.

  * Instead of selecting the container which holds our buttons, we are going to select each button individually.

  ```js
  const buttons = document.getElementsByTagName('button');
  ```

  * Lets create a function with a `count` variable set to zero.

  ```js
  const clickHandler = function () {

    let count = 0;

  ```

  * Next, we leverage closures by returning a function that increments our `count` variable by one.

  * The `this` keyword is referring to the `button` element that is being clicked.

  ```js
  const clickHandler = function () {

    let count = 0;

    return function () { 

      count++; 

      this.textContent = `Clicks: ${count}`;
    };
  ```
  
  * We are using a `for...loop` to attach an event listener to each `button` element.

  * üîë Now each button has its own reference to `count` instead of a reference to a global variable or attribute.

  * üîë Instead of doing a costly read on the DOM, we now only read and mutate the private `count` variable.

  ```js
  for (let i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {

    buttons[i].addEventListener('click', clickHandler());

  }
  ```

* If we open `20-Stu_Event-Delegation-Handling/Solved/index.html` in our browser we should see:

  * The buttons still work but now each button leverages closures.

  * üîë We no longer need to rely on the event to bubble up the DOM until it reaches a listener, avoiding costly reads on the DOM.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Do our buttons need to be inside of a container to work with closures?

  * üôã No, we attach the event listener to each button, avoiding event bubbling.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
