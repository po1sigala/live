# Unit 05 Instructor Overview: Third-Party-APIs

## Overview

In this unit, you will implement CDNs to leverage third-party APIs, such as CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, and custom fonts. You will use jQuery to perform DOM manipulation, implement Bootstrap and Google Fonts, and introduce jQuery UI and Moment.js.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/05-Third-Party-APIs/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* Expect students to have many issues with jQuery syntax. Be encouraging and let them know that the syntax will seem more intuitive over time. For now, they should just try to utilize the syntax as is.

* Take a few moments before class to get familiar both the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) documentation, as students will rely heavily on them in class and may need a nudge in finding answers.

* The 05.3 LP includes an `Everyone Do: Git` activity. If the students struggle with that activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Career Connection

Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [supplemental folder](../../../01-Class-Content/05-Third-Party-APIs/04-Supplemental/CAREER-CONNECTION.md).

## Heads-Up

Next unit, we will work with Server-Side APIs. It is recommended that you try to fill any conceptual holes students have about JavaScript objects this unit.
