# 05.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: jQuery UI and Moment.js

## Overview 

In today's class, students will implement jQuery UI, specifically widgets and interactions, to make a webpage more user-friendly. Students will also learn about formatting dates using `Moment.js`. `git revert` will be covered today as a part of the continuing education on git. And finally students will work on a Project Tracker mini-project at the end of class. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `21-Ins_jQuery-UI-Widgets` through `29-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries! Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Utilize jQuery UI widgets to make the webpage more user-friendly.

* Implement jQuery UI interactions to create sortable lists.

* Use Moment.js to calculate time differences.

* Apply the inverse of a commit by using `git revert`.

* Collaborate with teammates to create a Project Tracker app.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open `29-Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * You will work on creating this Project Tracker after the break, but let's take a sneak peak at some cool features here! 

  * When we click on "Add Project", a modal opens up and when we get to the "Due Date" field, we see a calendar that pops up which makes it easier for the user to choose a date.

  * After we add a project, we can see how many days are left until the due date.

  * Datepicker is a jQuery UI widget and calculating the days until the due date is done by using Moment.js. We will be learning more about both of these today!

### 2. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI Widgets (5 min) 

* Open [jQuery UI Docs on dialog](https://jqueryui.com/dialog/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë jQuery UI offers a combination of interaction, effects, widgets, utilities, and themes designed to work well together or on their own. 

  * üîë The Dialog widget is a basic dialog window that opens on top of a page, and can be moved, resized, and closed. We can use this to display instructions or announcements on a page.

  * üîë If we click on "view source", we can see the code for the widget.

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery-UI-Widgets/dialog-docs.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see that code for the dialog widget. Let's go through the code and tweak it a bit.
  
  * We see the jQuery UI `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
  />
  ```

  * Next, there's an imported stylesheet, but let's replace that with our own stylesheet.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
  ```

  * Let's also bring in Bootstrap.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  />
  ```

  * We can change the title and add our own content to the `<body>`.

  * We see the jQuery UI `<script>` tags at the end of the `<head>` section. But let's move those to the bottom, after the `</body>` tag.

  ```html
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js"></script>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
  <script>
    $(function () {
      $('#dialog').dialog();
    });
  </script>
  ```

  * Notice what the dialog function is doing. It is looking for an element with an id of `dialog` and applying the `.dialog()` to it. 
  
  * We can leave this in the `index.html` file or we can move it to a `script.js` file.

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery-UI-Widgets/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * After we tweak the code and make it our own, here is what it looks like. We can see our Bootstrap design along with the dialog box on top.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the jQuery UI documentation to figure out how to apply the widgets to our existing page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 3. Student Do: jQuery UI Widgets (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery UI Widgets

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery UI documentation to apply some jQuery UI widgets to the "Skills Form" to make it more user-friendly.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser.

  * We are given a simple Skills Form.

  * When we submit a Skill Name and Date, it is added to the List of Skills.

  * But it would be nice if the Skill Name can be autocompleted as we type the name, and if we can view a calendar when choosing a date!

* Using the documentation, implement the following jQuery UI widgets:

  * Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and apply the jQuery UI `<link>`  and `<script>` tags.

  * Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and add the following widgets:

    * An `Autocomplete` widget that will find and select from a pre-populated list of skills as users type in the "Skill Name" field of the "Skills Form". 

    * A `Datepicker` widget that will show month and year dropdowns in place of the static month/year header. 

## üí° Hint(s)

* You will need to add an array of skills to use with the `Autocomplete` widget. For example, `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `Bootstrap`, `React`, and `CSS`. 

* Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples on the `Datepicker` widget page of the jQuery UI docs.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge: 

  * What build-in HTML feature can also help enforce a date? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: jQuery UI Widgets (15 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with jQuery UI Widgets? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è jQuery UI `<link>` and `<script>` tags

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Autocomplete widget

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Datepicker widget

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë First, we bring in the jQuery UI `<link>` tag and put it in the `<head>`.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
  />    
  ```

  * üîë We also bring in the jQuery UI `<script>` tag and put it below the `</body>`.

  ```html
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>  
  ```

  * Notice we are using a separate file for our JavaScript. Let's open that now.

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We see functions for printing the skills on to the page and handling the form submit. 

  * üîë If we look at the [jQuery UI Widget Docs for Autocomplete](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/), we see that we need to create an array for the `.autocomplete()` function to find and select from. Everyone's array of skills will be different.

  ```js
  // Autocomplete widget
  $(function () {
    var skillNames = [
      'Bootstrap',
      'C',
      'C++',
      'CSS',
      'Express.js',
      'Git',
      'HTML',
      'Java',
      'JavaScript',
      'jQuery',
      'JSON',
      'MySQL',
      'Node.js',
      'NoSQL',
      'PHP',
      'Python',
      'React',
      'Ruby',
    ];
  ```

  * Then we look for the element that has an id of `skill-name`, which in our case is the `<input>` element, and apply the `.autocomplete()` function to it. It will check if what is being typed is one of the values of the `skillNames` array that we just created.

  ```js
  $('#skill-name').autocomplete({
    source: skillNames,
  });
  ```

  * üîë If we look at the [jQuery UI Widget Docs for Datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/), we see we have a lot of choices in terms of customizing it. For our activity purposes, we want to show the month and year in dropdowns in place of the static month/year header. 
  
  * So we look for ["Display month & year menus"](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#dropdown-month-year) and apply the additional boolean options.

  ```js
  // Datepicker widget
  $(function () {
    $('#datepicker').datepicker({
      changeMonth: true,
      changeYear: true,
    });
  });
  ```

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery-UI-Widgets/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see a "Skills Form" and when we start typing a skill name, we can see it will autocomplete it for us.

  * Then when we are choosing the date, we can see the calendar allows us to choose the month and year as a dropdown.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Can you think of other uses for the `Autocomplete` or `Datepicker` widgets?

  * üôã We could use the `Autocomplete` widget for entering the state field for an address. Or we could use the `Datepicker` widget when making an appointment.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [jQuery UI docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 5. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI Interactions (5 min) 

* Open [jQuery UI Docs on Sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Interactions add basic mouse-based behaviors to any element. We can drag and drop items or sort items in a list. 

  * üîë The Sortable interaction allows the user to reorder elements in a list or grid using the mouse. Let's try that now!

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/sortable-docs.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see the code for the sortable interaction taken straight from the docs. Let's go through the code and tweak it a bit.

  * Again, let's clean up the `<head>` section by importing our own stylesheet, moving the `<style>` to that stylesheet, moving the `<script>` tags down to the bottom of the page. 

  ```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>jQuery UI Sortable - Default functionality</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
  </head>
  ```

  * In the `<body>` let's make a list of skills that we will learn through this course. Can you name some skills that you are looking forward to learning? (Take answers from the students and use them below).

  ```html
  <body>
    <h1>jQuery UI Interactions - Sortable</h1>
    <h2>What are you most excited to learn more about?</h2>
    <div>
      <ul id="sortable">
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          Node.js
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          HTML
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          MySQL
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          Express.js
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          NoSQL
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          React
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          JavaScript
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
  ``` 

  * Lastly, notice what the sortable function is doing. It is looking for an element with an id of `sortable` and applying the `.sortable()` to it. Right afterwards, it will `.disableSelect()`.
  
  ```html
  <script>
    $(function () {
      $('#sortable').sortable();
      $('#sortable').disableSelection();
    });
  </script>
  ```

  * Again, we can leave this in the `index.html` file or we can move it to a `script.js` file.

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see our list of skills that we are most excited to learn more about. 
  
  * We can order them any way we want by dragging it up and down the list.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the jQuery UI documentation to figure out how to apply the interaction we want to our existing page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 6. Student Do: jQuery UI Interactions (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_jQuery-UI-Interactions/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery UI Interactions

* In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery UI documentation to apply a jQuery UI interaction to the "List of Skills" so that a user can reorder the list items.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser.

  * We are given a Skills Form. 
  
  * When we submit a skill name and date, it is added to the List of Skills.

  * But it would be nice if we can reorder the skills on the list!

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following jQuery UI interaction:

  * Add the appropriate jQuery UI interaction that will allow the user to drag and reorder the skills listed under "List of Skills".

  * Add the option to style that white space in between the items shifting to be visible. 

## üí° Hint(s)

* Think about which interaction will allow a user to drag an element to a new spot on the list.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge: 

  * How exactly does this "HTML Drag and Drop" work?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to dig deeper into how this works.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: jQuery UI Interactions (15 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with jQuery UI Interactions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Sortable interaction

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `placeholder` option

* Open `24-Stu_jQuery-UI-Interactions/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * According to the [jQuery UI Interactions Docs](https://jqueryui.com/sortable), in order to allow the user to drag and reorder the skills listed under "List of Skills", we need to use the Sortable interaction.

  * üîë We look for the element that has an id of `skills-list`, which is our "List of Skills" that will get populated by the user, and apply the `.sortable()` function to it.

  ```js
  $(function () {
    $('#skills-list').sortable();
    $('#skills-list').disableSelection();
  });
  ```

  * üîë However we also want to add the option of seeing the white space in between the items shifting. According to the ["Drop placeholder"](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#placeholder) option, we can do just that.

  ```js
  $(function () {
    $('#skills-list').sortable({
      placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight',
    });
      $('#skills-list').disableSelection();
  });
  ```

* Open `24-Stu_jQuery-UI-Interactions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see the same Skills Form as the previous activity. Let's go ahead and add some skills to the "List of Skills".

  * Now when we want to order the list, we can drag and drop the skills and we see a yellow placeholder box underneath.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between the Sortable interaction and the Draggable and Droppable interactions?

  * üôã The Draggable interaction allows you to move an item anywhere on the screen. The Droppable interaction is similar but you need to drag the item and drop it on a target.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Moment.js Format (5 min) 

* Open the [Moment.js Docs on Format](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/) in your browser and explain the following:

  * üîë We use `moment().format()` to format dates and times. There are many different ways we can format the date and time.

* Open `25-Ins_Moment-Format/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see questions about the date and time, and they are answered according to the current date and time.

* Open `25-Ins_Moment-Format/index.html` in your IDE and observe the following:

  * Here we only see the questions printed to the screen. The answers were calculated in `script.js`

* Open `25-Ins_Moment-Format/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * First we need to create a moment object for today. We will use this in all of our answers.

  ```js
  var today = moment();
  ```

  * For the answer to the first question, we format the moment object `today` to use `MM Do, YYYY` format. 

  ```js
  $("#1a").text(today.format("MMM Do, YYYY"));
  ```

  * For the second question, we format `today` to say which day of the week it is using `dddd`.

  ```js
  var dayWeek = today.format("[Today is] dddd")
  $("#2a").text(dayWeek);
  ```

  * For the third question, we parse the 11/3/2020 and reformat it into `dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a` format.

  ```js
  var reformatDate = moment("11/3/20", "MM-DD-YY").format("dddd, MMMM Do YYYY, h:mm:ss a");
  $("#3a").text(reformatDate);
  ```

  * Lastly, we determine what week of the year we fall on right now, and use a `if/else` statement to determine if it is odd or even. Then we print on to the screen a boolean along with the current week number.

  ```js
  var weekNum = today.format("w");
  var takeOut;
  // Check odd, then assign boolean
  if(weekNum % 2) {
    takeOut = true;
  } else {
    takeOut = false;
  }

  $("#4a").text(takeOut + ", because it's currently week " + weekNum);
  ```
  
* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the Moment.js documentation to figure out how to use `moment.js` to format the date and time. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 9. Student Do: Moment.js Format (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Moment-Format/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Moment Format

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use Moment.js documentation to format dates and print them on to the page.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [Moment.js Docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/) in your browser.

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We see a list of questions regarding different dates and different formatting of dates.

  * We want to answer these questions and print the correct dates on to the page using the format requested.

  * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to format the date that answers the questions and assign them to the declared variable provided.

## üí° Hint(s)

* Refer to the official docs for [Moment.js parsing](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/) to format ISO 8601 strings.

* Check out [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser to see your progress.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an bonus exercise: 
  
  * How can we measure the difference between two time stamps with `Moment.js`?

* Read the [Moment.js Docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/) to dig deeper into how this works.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. Instructor Review: Moment.js Format (15 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with Moment.js? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Formatting given date

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Formatting current date

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Formatting Unix timestamp

* Open `26-Stu_Moment-Format/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë The first two questions requires us to format a given date. We parse the date that needs to be reformatted and then specify how we want to display the date. You could've used any date for the graduation date.

  ```js
  var gradDate = moment("2021-06-15").format("MMM Do, YYYY");

  var weekDay = moment("1-1-2022", "M-D-YYYY").format("ddd MMM Do, YYYY");
  ```

  * üîë The following questions requires us to format our current date and time. We use `moment()` for our current date and time, and then specify how we want to display it.

  ```js
  var dayYear = moment().format("DDD");

  var time = moment().format("hh:mm:ss");

  var unix = moment().format("X");
  ```

  * For the last question, we had to parse the Unix timestamp and convert it into date and time.

  ```js
  var unixFormat = moment.unix(1318781876).format("MMM Do, YYYY, hh:mm:ss");
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we add words other than the formatted date to be displayed on the screen?

  * üôã We can use `[]` brackets. For example, if today is Saturday, then `moment().format("[Today is] dddd")` will display the full string "Today is Saturday".

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Moment.js docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 11. Everyone Do: Git Revert (20 mins)

* Open [Git Revert docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) in your browser and explain the following:

  * As you work with your teammates on projects and other collaborative work, there will be times when you wish you can "undo" a commit. 

  * `git revert` isn't exactly an "undo" operation, but what it will do is figure out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and then append a new commit with the resulting inverse content. This way you are not losing any history, which is very important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration with others.

  * Let's say you are working with your classmates on a project and you are trying to fix a bug. You find out that the bug was caused by a single commit. Then you can use `git revert` to go fix it and commit a new snapshot. 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Git-Revert/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

* If necessary, you can review this activity. Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Let's see this in action! I'm going to create a new directory for us to test this in and `cd` into it. Then we will initialize an empty git repo in that directory to practice in.

    ```bash
    mkdir git_revert_demo
    cd git_revert_demo
    git init .
    ```

* Open the newly created `git_revert_demo` directory in your IDE and copy the `27-Ins_Git-Revert/script.js` file into it.

  * We are taking the `script.js` file from our jQuery UI activity. First, we will make our initial commit.

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m 'initial commit'
  ```

  * Then let's add the `Autocomplete` widget to `script.js` and commit that.

  ```js
  // Autocomplete widget
  $(function () {
    var skillNames = [
      'Bootstrap',
      'C',
      'C++',
      'CSS',
      'Express.js',
      'Git',
      'HTML',
      'Java',
      'JavaScript',
      'jQuery',
      'JSON',
      'MySQL',
      'Node.js',
      'NoSQL',
      'PHP',
      'Python',
      'React',
      'Ruby',
    ];
    $('#skill-name').autocomplete({
      source: skillNames,
    });
  });
  ```

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m 'added Autocomplete widget'
  ```

  * Do the same for the `Datepicker` widget.

  ```js
  // Datepicker widget
  $(function () {
    $('#datepicker').datepicker({
      changeMonth: true,
      changeYear: true,
    });
  });
  ```

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m 'added Datepicker widget'
  ```

  * Lastly let's add the `Sortable` interaction.

  ```js
  // Sortable interaction
  $(function () {
    $('#skills-list').sortable({
      placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight',
    });
    $('#skills-list').disableSelection();
  });
  ```

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m 'added Sortable interaction'
  ```

  * Now if we invoke `git log` to display the commit history, we see all 4 commits. But let's say the `Sortable` interaction was a mistake and was causing bugs. We can use `git revert` to revert back to before we made that commit.

  * `git revert` requires a commit reference and will not execute without one. Here we pass in the `HEAD` which will revert the latest commit. 

  ```bash
  git revert HEAD
  ```

  * This will create a new commit which will open up the commit message editor prompting for a new commit message. When Git is finished, we can use `git log` to see that there is a new commit added which reverted the `added Sortable interaction` commit.

  * When we check the `script.js` file, we see that the `Sortable` interaction is indeed gone. And we have a record of all the commit in the project history.

  * If we look at the [Git Revert Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert#_options), we see various options we can also use. One useful one is the `--no-edit` option. This will not open the commit message editor and will automatically write a commit message for you.

  * We can try this out! Let's say we want to revert the `added Autocomplete widget` commit. After we run `git log` we need to get the commit number and use it in our `git revert`.

  ```bash
  git revert --no-edit <add commit number>
  ```

  * When we run `git log`, we can see the automatically generated commit message `Revert "added Autocomplete widget"` and when we check the `script.js` file, the widget is no longer there.

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

### 12. BREAK (40 mins)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini Project (5 min) 

* Open `29-Stu_Mini_Project/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see a header with the title "Project Tracker" with the current time and date. On the left, we see instructions for adding a project to the Project Tracker.

  * üîë When we click on "Add Project", a modal pops up and we can add the information requested.

  * üîë Once we submit that form, we see the project listed in the table.

  * üîë When we click on the "x", that project is deleted from the list. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã Working in groups of 3-4, we will break up the different tasks amongst the group members and try to finish at least the first three tasks. We need to create an `index.html` file for the HTML and a `script.js` file for the JavaScript and jQuery. When in doubt, we can refer to the official documentation for Bootstrap, jQuery, jQueryUI, Moment, and Google Fonts.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini Project (60 mins)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `29-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Mini Project - Project Tracker

In this project, you will work with others to create a project tracker application using Bootstrap, jQuery, jQueryUI, Moment, and Google Fonts. Break up these phases amongst members of your team.

The first three tasks will get you to MVP, so focus on those first!

## Instructions

### Task 1 - HTML Build

* Create a header/hero area that welcomes users to the application and displays the current time and date using Moment.js with a `setInterval()`

* Create a Bootstrap card component explaining the instructions of how to use the app and a button to open a modal dialog (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/modal/)

* The modal should contain a form asking users to fill in the following data:

  * The project's name

  * The project's type (use a `<select>` dropdown)

  * Your hourly wage for the project work

  * The project's due date (use jQuery UI's datepicker with a minimum date setting in place)

* A Bootstrap table that the project's information can be printed to that has columns for the following data:

  * The project's name

  * The project's type

  * The hourly wage

  * The due date

  * Days until the due date (use Moment calculate)

  * Estimated total earned (Hourly wage at 8 hrs/day times how many days until the due date)

* Things to keep in mind while you build:

  * Make sure any elements you need to interact with using JavaScript/jQuery are properly identified (e.g. form elements, the table body, etc.)

  * Use different `<input>` element attributes to help enforce rules such as different `type` attribute values, minimum values, and required! (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

  * When in doubt, read the Bootstrap documentation.

---

### Task 2 - Capture Form Data

* Using jQuery, set up functionality to capture the form's input elements on submit and use that data to create a new table row on the page.

* Select and save references to every DOM element we will interact with to a variable (i.e. `var projectFormEl = $("#project-form");`) so these elements can be used later.

* Attach a "submit" event listener to the `<form>` element using jQuery.

* Upon submission, capture the four input values from the form and pass them to another function to handle printing project data. Having a function to capture the data and another function to print the data to the page's `<table>` element will help with code readability.

---

### Task 3 - Print Project Data to Page

* Create a function that will accept the four input fields' data as arguments.

* Create a table row (`<tr>`) element and save it to a variable.

* Create a table detail (`<td>`) element for each of the table columns created in Task 1 above.

* For printing the days to the due date, use Moment to get the difference between the due date and the current time in days. 

* For printing the estimated total earned amount, assume that you work an 8 hour day. So multiply the hourly rate by 8 to get the daily rate, then multiply that value by how many days until the project is due to get the estimated total earned. 

* Append all `<td>` elements to the table row created, then append the entire row to the `<tbody>` element on the page.

* Don't forget to close the modal when done!

---

### Task 4 - Delete a Project From the Table

* Update the table to accommodate one more column without a name.

* When generating a new `<tr>` for a project, add one more `<td>` that holds a button for deleting a project from the list.

* Use jQuery event delegation to attach an event listener to each of those buttons that when clicked, the parent `<tr>` element will be removed from the page.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini Project (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Bootstrap modal

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Capture form content

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Moment time differences

  * ‚úîÔ∏è jQuery event delegation

* Open `29-Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We don't have time to go over every part of this mini-project, however we will go over the key points.

  * üîë If we look at the official docs for Bootstrap Modals, we can get the general code for the modal. In the modal, we are going to put in a form. Notice what the `id` for the input fields are.

  ```js
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="project-name-input">Project Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="project-name-input" class="form-control" placeholder="Enter the project's name"
      required />
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="project-type-input">Project Type</label>
    <select class="form-control" id="project-type-input">
      <option selected disabled>Pick one...</option>
      <option value="Web Application (Front End)">Web Application (Front End)</option>
      <option value="Web Application (Back End)">Web Application (Back End)</option>
      <option value="Web Application (Full Stack)">Web Application (Full Stack)</option>
      <option value="Mobile Application">Mobile Application</option>
      <option value="Print Campaign">Print Campaign</option>
      <option value="Digital Marketing Campaign">Digital Marketing Campaign</option>
    </select>
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="hourly-rate-input">Hourly Rate ($)</label>
    <input type="number" id="hourly-rate-input" class="form-control" placeholder="$" min="0" required />
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="due-date-input">Due Date</label>
    <input type="text" min='1' id="due-date-input" class="form-control" placeholder="When is the project due?"
      required />
  </div>
  ```

  * üîë If we look at the function for handling the form submit in `script.js`, we see how we are capturing the form content:

  ```js
  var projectNameInputEl = $('#project-name-input');
  var projectTypeInputEl = $('#project-type-input');
  var hourlyRateInputEl = $('#hourly-rate-input');
  var dueDateInputEl = $('#due-date-input');

  function handleProjectFormSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();

    var projectName = projectNameInputEl.val().trim();
    var projectType = projectTypeInputEl.val().trim();
    var hourlyRate = hourlyRateInputEl.val().trim();
    var dueDate = dueDateInputEl.val().trim();

    printProjectData(projectName, projectType, hourlyRate, dueDate);

    projectFormEl[0].reset();
  }
  ```

  * üîë We use `moment.js` to format the time and calculate the difference between now and the due date:

  ```js
  function displayTime() {
    var rightNow = moment().format('MMM DD, YYYY [at] hh:mm:ss a');
    timeDisplayEl.text(rightNow);
  }

  var daysToDate = moment(dueDate, 'MM/DD').diff(moment(), 'days');
  ```

  * üîë And finally, if you got to Task 4, when we delete a project from the table, we are attaching an event listener to a button for each `<tr>` and when it is clicked, that `<tr>` element will be removed from the page:

  ```js
  // In printProjectData()
  var deleteProjectBtn = $('<td>').addClass('p-2 delete-project-btn text-center').text('X');

  // Remove <tr> when button is clicked
  function handleDeleteProject(event) {
    console.log(event.target);
    var btnClicked = $(event.target);
    btnClicked.parent('tr').remove();
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How are we printing the time to the page every second in the header?

  * üôã We are using `setInterval()` to call the function `displayTime()`, which uses `moment.js` to format the current time and appends it to the page, every second. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the official documentation like [MDN web docs on HTML <input> element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input) or [Bootstrap Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/modal/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Introduce Homework (5 min)

* Open `02-Homework/Master/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see a daily planner with the current day displayed on top and a calendar with timeblocks.

  * Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether that hour is in the past, present, or future according to the current time.

  * When we click on a timeblock, we can add an event and hit save.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. We are also using `Moment.js` to work with the date and time.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã It is using our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as well as the newly learned `Moment.js` library and Bootstrap.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã We are creating interactive webpages that are dynamically updated using JavaScript. We are also learning to use different libraries that enhance the quality of our web apps.

* Ask TAs to Slack the Homework Requirements found in `02-Homework/README.md` to the students in their class-specific channel.
