# 05.3 Lesson Plan: jQuery UI and Moment.js

## Overview 

In today's class, students will learn about jQuery UI, more specifically widgets and interactions. Students will also learn about formatting dates using Moment.js. `git revert` will be covered today as a part of the continuing education on git. And finally students will work on a Project Tracker mini-project at the end of class. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `21-Ins_jQuery_UI_Widgets` through `29-Stu_Mini_Project`.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, share your struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with the concepts covered in this lesson.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Utilize jQuery UI widgets to make the webpage more user-friendly

* Implement jQuery UI interactions to create sortable lists.

* Use Moment.js to calculate time differences

* Apply the inverse of a commit by using `git revert`

* Collaborate with teammates to create a Project Tracker app

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open `29-Stu_Mini_Project/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * You will work on creating this Project Tracker after the break, but let's take a look at a cool feature here. 

  * When we click on "Add Project", a modal opens up and when we get to the "Due Date" field, we see a calendar that pops up which makes it easier for the user to choose a date.

  * After we add a project, we can see how many days are left until the due date.

  * Datepicker is a jQuery UI widget and calculating the days until the due date is done by using Moment.js. We will be learning more about both of these today!

### 2. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI Widgets (5 min) 

* Open [jQuery UI Docs on dialog](https://jqueryui.com/dialog/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë jQuery UI offers a combination of interaction, effects, widgets, utilities, and themes designed to work well together or on their own. 

  * üîë The Dialog widget is a basic dialog window that opens on top of a page, and can be moved, resized, and closed. We can use this to display instructions or announcements on a page.

  * üîë If we click on "view source", we can see the code for the widget.

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery_UI_Widgets/dialog-docs.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see that code for the dialog widget. Let's go through the code and tweak it a bit.
  
  * We see the jQuery UI `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
  />
  ```

  * Next, there's an imported stylesheet, but let's replace that with our own stylesheet.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
  ```

  * Let's also bring in Bootstrap.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  />
  ```

  * We can change the title and add our own content to the `<body>`.

  * We see the jQuery UI `<script>` tags at the end of the `<head>` section. But let's move those to the bottom, after the `</body>` tag.

  ```html
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js"></script>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
  <script>
    $(function () {
      $('#dialog').dialog();
    });
  </script>
  ```

  * Notice what the dialog function is doing. It is looking for an element with an id of `dialog` and applying the `.dialog()` to it. 
  
  * We can leave this in the `index.html` file or we can move it to a `script.js` file.

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery_UI_Widgets/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * After we tweak the code and make it our own, here is what it looks like. We can see our Bootstrap design along with the dialog box on top.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the jQuery UI documentation to figure out how to apply the widgets to our existing page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 3. Student Do: jQuery UI Widgets (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_jQuery_UI_Widgets/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery UI Widgets

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery UI documentation to apply some jQuery UI widgets to the "Skills Form" to make it more user-friendly.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/).

* Using the documentation, implement the following jQuery UI widgets:

  * Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and apply the jQuery UI `<link>`  and `<script>` tag.

  * Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and add the following widgets:

    * An `Autocomplete` widget that will find and select from a pre-populated list of skills as users type in the "Skill Name" field of the "Skills Form". 

    * A `Datepicker` widget that will show month and year dropdowns in place of the static month/year header. 

## üí° Hint(s)

* You will need to add an array of skills to use with the `Autocomplete` widget.

* Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples on the `Datepicker` widget page of the jQuery UI docs.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge: 

  * What build-in HTML feature can also help enforce a date? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: jQuery UI Widgets (15 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `jQuery UI Widgets`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è jQuery UI `<link>` and `<script>` tags

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Autocomplete widget

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Datepicker widget

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery_UI_Widgets/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë First, we bring in the jQuery UI `<link>` tag and put it in the `<head>`.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
  />    
  ```

  * We also bring in the jQuery UI `<script>` tag and put it below the `</body>`.

  ```html
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>  
  ```

  * Notice we are using a separate file for our JavaScript. Let's open that now.

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery_UI_Widgets/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We see functions for printing the skills on to the page and handling the form submit. 

  * üîë If we look at the [jQuery UI Widget Docs for Autocomplete](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/), we see that we need to create an array for the `.autocomplete()` function to find and select from.

  ```js
  // Autocomplete widget
  $(function () {
    var skillNames = [
      'Bootstrap',
      'C',
      'C++',
      'CSS',
      'Express.js',
      'Git',
      'HTML',
      'Java',
      'JavaScript',
      'jQuery',
      'JSON',
      'MySQL',
      'Node.js',
      'NoSQL',
      'PHP',
      'Python',
      'React',
      'Ruby',
    ];
  ```

  * Then we look for the element that has an id of `skill-name`, which in our case is the `<input>` element, and apply the `.autocomplete()` function to it. It will check if what is being typed is one of the values of the `skillNames` array that we just created.

  ```js
  $('#skill-name').autocomplete({
    source: skillNames,
  });
  ```

  * üîë If we look at the [jQuery UI Widget Docs for Datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/), we see we have a lot of choices in terms of customizing it. For our activity purposes, we want to show the month and year in dropdowns in place of the static month/year header. 
  
  * So we look for ["Display month & year menus"](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#dropdown-month-year) and apply the additional boolean options.

  ```js
  // Datepicker widget
  $(function () {
    $('#datepicker').datepicker({
      changeMonth: true,
      changeYear: true,
    });
  });
  ```

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery_UI_Widgets/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see a "Skills Form" and when we start typing a skill name, we can see it will autocomplete it for us.

  * Then when we are choosing the date, we can see the calendar allows us to choose the month and year as a dropdown.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Can you think of other uses for the `Autocomplete` or `Datepicker` widgets?

  * üôã We could use the `Autocomplete` widget for entering the state field for an address. Or we could use the `Datepicker` widget when making an appointment.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [jQuery UI docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 5. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI Interactions (5 min) 

* Open [jQuery UI Docs on Sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Interactions add basic mouse-based behaviors to any element. We can drag and drop items or sort items in a list. 

  * üîë The Sortable interaction allows the user to reorder elements in a list or grid using the mouse. Let's try that now!

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/sortable-docs.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see the code for the sortable interaction taken straight from the docs. Let's go through the code and tweak it a bit.

  * Again, let's clean up the `<head>` section by importing our own stylesheet, moving the `<style>` to that stylesheet, moving the `<script>` tags down to the bottom of the page. 

  ```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>jQuery UI Sortable - Default functionality</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
  </head>
  ```

  * In the `<body>` let's make a list of skills that we will learn through our bootcamp. Can you name some skills that you are looking forward to learning?

  ```html
  <body>
    <h1>jQuery UI Interactions - Sortable</h1>
    <h2>What are you most excited to learn more about?</h2>
    <div>
      <ul id="sortable">
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          Node.js
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          HTML
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          MySQL
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          Express.js
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          NoSQL
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          React
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          JavaScript
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
  ``` 

  * Lastly, notice what the sortable function is doing. It is looking for an element with an id of `sortable` and applying the `.sortable()` to it. Right afterwards, it will `.disableSelect()`.
  
  ```html
  <script>
    $(function () {
      $('#sortable').sortable();
      $('#sortable').disableSelection();
    });
  </script>
  ```

  * Again, we can leave this in the `index.html` file or we can move it to a `script.js` file.

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see our list of skills that we are most excited to learn more about. 
  
  * We can order them any way we want by dragging it up and down the list.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the jQuery UI documentation to figure out how to apply the interaction we want to our existing page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 6. Student Do: jQuery UI Interactions (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_jQuery_UI_Interactions/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery UI Interactions

* In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery UI documentation to apply a jQuery UI interaction to the "List of Skills" so that a user can reorder the list items.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/).

* Using the documentation, implement the following jQuery UI interaction:

  * Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and add the jQuery UI interaction that will allow the user to drag and reorder the skills listed under "List of Skills".

  * Add the option to style that white space in between the items shifting to be visible. 

## üí° Hint(s)

* Think about which interaction will allow a user to drag an element to a new spot on the list.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge: 

  * How exactly does this "HTML Drag and Drop" work?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to dig deeper into how this works.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: jQuery UI Interactions (15 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `jQuery UI Interactions`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Sortable interaction

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `placeholder` option

* Open `24-Stu_jQuery_UI_Interactions/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * According to the [jQuery UI Interactions Docs](https://jqueryui.com/sortable), in order to allow the user to drag and reorder the skills listed under "List of Skills", we need to use the Sortable interaction.

  * üîë We look for the element that has an id of `skills-list`, which is our "List of Skills" that will get populated by the user, and apply the `.sortable()` function to it.

  ```js
  $(function () {
    $('#skills-list').sortable();
    $('#skills-list').disableSelection();
  });
  ```

  * üîë However we also want to add the option of seeing the white space in between the items shifting. According to the ["Drop placeholder"](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#placeholder) option, we can do just that.

  ```js
  $(function () {
    $('#skills-list').sortable({
      placeholder: 'ui-state-highlight',
    });
      $('#skills-list').disableSelection();
  });
  ```

* Open `24-Stu_jQuery_UI_Interactions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We see the same Skills Form as the previous activity. Let's go ahead and add some skills to the "List of Skills".

  * Now when we want to order the list, we can drag and drop the skills and we see a yellow placeholder box underneath.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between the Sortable interaction and the Draggable and Droppable interactions?

  * üôã The Draggable interaction allows you to move an item anywhere on the screen. The Droppable interaction is similar but you need to drag the item and drop it on a target.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Moment.js Format (5 min) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * üîë @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 9. Student Do: Moment.js Format (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
  @TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS; TABBED
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. Instructor Review: Moment.js Format (15 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `@TODO TOPIC`. (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THIS }

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THAT }

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

  ```
  @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
  ```

  * üîë @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * üôã @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã @TODO We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 11. Instructor Demo: Git Revert (20 mins)

* Open [Git Revert docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-revert) in your browser and explain the following:

  * As you work with your teammates on projects and other collaborative work, there will be times when you wish you can "undo" a commit. 

  * `git revert` isn't exactly an "undo" operation, but what it will do is figure out how to invert the changes introduced by the commit and then appends a new commit with the resulting inverse content. This way you are not losing any history, which is very important for the integrity of your revision history and for reliable collaboration with others.

  * Let's say you are working with your classmates on a project and you are trying to fix a bug. You find out that the bug was caused by a single commit. Then you can use `git revert` to go fix it and commit a new snapshot. 

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Let's see this in action! 

### 12. BREAK (40 mins)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini Project (5 min) 

* Open `29-Stu_Mini_Project/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We see a header with the title "Project Tracker" with the current time and date. On the left, we see instructions for adding a project to the Project Tracker.

  * üîë When we click on "Add Project", a modal pops up and we can add the information requested.

  * üîë Once we submit that form, we see the project listed in the table.

  * üîë When we click on the "x", that project is deleted from the list. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã Working in your groups, break up the different tasks amongst the members and try to finish at least the first three tasks. Create an `index.html` file for your HTML and a `script.js` file for your JavaScript and jQuery. When in doubt, read the official documentation for Bootstrap, jQuery, jQueryUI, Moment, and Google Fonts.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini Project (60 mins)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
    @TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS; TABBED
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 15. Instructor Review: { ACTIVITY NAME } (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `@TODO TOPIC`. (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THIS }

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THAT }

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following:
