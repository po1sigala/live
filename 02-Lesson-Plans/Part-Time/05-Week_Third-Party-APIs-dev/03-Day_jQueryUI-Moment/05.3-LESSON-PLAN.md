# 05.3 Lesson Plan: jQuery UI and Moment.js

## Overview 

This lesson introduces jQuery UI widgets and interactions and Moment.js

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `21-Ins_jQuery_UI_Widgets` through `XX-Stu_Activity-Title`

* @TODO Each Instructor Note block begins with the bullet above, outlining what activities will be covered during class.

* @TODO Empathize with the instructor. If you only had one hour to prepare for class, what are the things you would want to know up front? What are the potential pitfalls in class? Where are students going to get hung up? 

* @TODO Set the instructor up for success.

## Learning Objectives

* @TODO Bullet the learning objectives for the lesson plan. Refer to your Activity Planner.

* @TODO When writing learning objectives, refer to this list of measurable verbs used to assess learning outcomes https://www.clinton.edu/curriculumcommittee/listofmeasurableverbs.cxml

* @TODO For example, "Initialize projects and install third-party packages using npm"

* @TODO If it's a concept and not a demonstrable skill, use "explain". For example, "Explain the client-server model"

* @TODO Don't use "Understand..." as it is not measurable

* @TODO Aim for at least 3 points, but no more than 6. If you find yourself listing more than six points you may need to rethink the scope of your points or the lesson plan itself.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* @TODO Demo preview of Train Scheduler

* Navigate to `29-Stu_Mini_Project` from the command line and run `node index.js` to demonstrate the following: 

  * When we select "View All Employees," we see the contents of the `employees` table combined with data from other tables.

  * When we select "Add Employee," we can input different data points to insert a new record in the table.

### 2. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI Widgets (5 min) 

* Open [jQuery UI Docs on dialog](https://jqueryui.com/dialog/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë jQuery UI offers a combination of interaction, effects, widgets, utilities, and themes designed to work well together or on their own. 

  * üîë The Dialog widget is a basic dialog window that opens on top of a page, and can be moved, resized, and closed. We can use this to display instructions or announcements on a page.

  * üîë If we click on "view source", we can see the code for the widget.

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery_UI_Widgets/dialog-docs.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see that code for the dialog widget. Let's go through the code and tweak it a bit.
  
  * We see the jQuery UI `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
  />
  ```

  * Let's replace the following stylesheet with our own stylesheet.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
  ```

  * Let's also bring in Bootstrap.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/twitter-bootstrap/4.5.0/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  />
  ```

  * We can change the title and add our own content to the `<body>`.

  * We see the jQuery UI `<script>` tags at the end of the `<head>` section. But let's move those to the bottom, after the `</body>` tag.

  ```html
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.12.4.js"></script>
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>
  <script>
    $(function () {
      $('#dialog').dialog();
    });
  </script>
  ```

  * Notice what the dialog function is doing. It is looking for an element with an id of `dialog` and applying the `.dialog()` to it. We can leave this in the `index.html` file or we can move it to a `script.js` file.

* Open `21-Ins_jQuery_UI_Widgets/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * After we tweak the code and make it our own, here is what it looks like. We can see our Bootstrap design along with the dialog box on top.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the jQuery UI documentation to figure out how to apply the widgets to our existing page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 3. Student Do: jQuery UI Widgets (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_jQuery_UI_Widgets/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery UI Widgets

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery UI documentation to apply some jQuery UI widgets to the "Skills Form" to make it more user-friendly.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/).

* Using the documentation, implement the following jQuery UI widgets:

  * Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and apply the jQuery UI `<link>` element and `<script>` tag.

  * Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and add the following widgets:

    * An `Autocomplete` widget that will find and select from a pre-populated list of skills as users type in the "Skill Name" field of the "Skills Form". 

    * A `Datepicker` widget that will show month and year dropdowns in place of the static month/year header. 

## üí° Hint(s)

* You will need to add an array of skills to use with the `Autocomplete` widget.

* Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples on the `Datepicker` widget page of the jQuery UI docs.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge: 

  * What build-in HTML feature can also help enforce a date? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: jQuery UI Widgets (15 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `jQuery UI Widgets`? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è jQuery UI `<link>` and `<script>` tags

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Autocomplete widget

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Datepicker widget

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery_UI_Widgets/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë First, we bring in the jQuery UI `<link>` tag and put it in the `<head>`.

  ```html
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
  />    
  ```

  * We also bring in the jQuery UI `<script>` tag and put it below the `</body>`.

  ```html
  <script src="https://code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/jquery-ui.js"></script>  
  ```

  * Notice we are using a separate file for our JavaScript. Let's open that now.

* Open `22-Stu_jQuery_UI_Widgets/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We see functions for printing the skills on to the page and handling the form submit. 

  * üîë If we look at the [jQuery UI Widget Docs for Autocomplete](https://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/), we see that we need to create an array for the `.autocomplete()` function to find and select from.

  ```js
  // Autocomplete widget
  $(function () {
    var skillNames = [
      'Bootstrap',
      'C',
      'C++',
      'CSS',
      'Express.js',
      'Git',
      'HTML',
      'Java',
      'JavaScript',
      'jQuery',
      'JSON',
      'MySQL',
      'Node.js',
      'NoSQL',
      'PHP',
      'Python',
      'React',
      'Ruby',
    ];
  ```

  * Then we look for the element that has an id of `skill-name`, which in our case is the `<input>` element, and apply the `.autocomplete()` function to it. It will check if what is being typed is one of the values of the `skillNames` array that we just created.

  ```js
  $('#skill-name').autocomplete({
    source: skillNames,
  });
  ```

  * üîë If we look at the [jQuery UI Widget Docs for Datepicker](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/), we see we have a lot of choices in terms of customizing it. For our activity purposes, we want to show the month and year in dropdowns in place of the static month/year header. 
  
  * So we look for ["Display month & year menus"](https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#dropdown-month-year) and apply the additional boolean options.

  ```js
  // Datepicker widget
  $(function () {
    $('#datepicker').datepicker({
      changeMonth: true,
      changeYear: true,
    });
  });
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * üôã @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã @TODO We can refer to the lesson plan, read the [jQuery UI docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 5. Instructor Demo: jQuery UI Interactions (5 min) 

* Open [jQuery UI Docs on Sortable](https://jqueryui.com/sortable/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë Interactions add basic mouse-based behaviors to any element. We can drag and drop items or sort items in a list. 

  * üîë The Sortable interaction allows the user to reorder elements in a list or grid using the mouse. Let's try that now!

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/sortable-docs.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see the code for the sortable interaction taken straight from the docs. Let's go through the code and tweak it a bit.

  * Again, let's clean up the `<head>` section by importing our own stylesheet, moving the `<style>` to that stylesheet, moving the `<script>` tags down to the bottom of the page. 

  ```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <title>jQuery UI Sortable - Default functionality</title>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="//code.jquery.com/ui/1.12.1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css"
    />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
  </head>
  ```

  * In the `<body>` let's make a list of skills that we will learn through our bootcamp. Can you name some skills that you are looking forward to learning?

  ```html
  <body>
    <h1>jQuery UI Interactions - Sortable</h1>
    <h2>What are you most excited to learn more about?</h2>
    <div>
      <ul id="sortable">
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          Node.js
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          HTML
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          MySQL
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          Express.js
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          NoSQL
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          React
        </li>
        <li class="ui-state-default">
          JavaScript
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
  ``` 

  * Lastly, notice what the sortable function is doing. It is looking for an element with an id of `sortable` and applying the `.sortable()` to it. Again, we can leave this in the `index.html` file or we can move it to a `script.js` file.

* Open `23-Ins_jQuery_UI_Interactions/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Here we see our list of skills that we are most excited to learn more about. We can order them any way we want.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We will need to read the jQuery UI documentation to figure out how to apply the interaction we want to our existing page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.
