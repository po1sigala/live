# Lesson Plan: CSS Frameworks with Bootstrap and Google Fonts (6:30 PM)

## Overview 

This class introduces Bootstrap, the concepts of a CSS framework, and Google Fonts. Students will rely heavily on documentation to build web pages using prebuilt UI components, the Bootstrap grid system, utility classes, and customize those pages with Google Fonts and CSS.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_Bootstrap-Components` through `20-Stu_Google-Fonts`

* Take a few moments before class to get familiar both the Bootstrap and Google Fonts documentation, as students will rely heavily on them in class and may need a nudge in finding answers.

* It's important that students understand that Bootstrap is simply a large stylesheet and utilizes a lot of skills they already know. If students are struggling with certain concepts, try and jog their memory of learning CSS and emphasize the use of DevTools to break down styles being used.

* Reiterate often that like CSS, using Bootstrap classes and Google Fonts requires a bit of trial-and-error to achieve the intended design and layout. Encourage students to try using different variations of classes and fonts to become more comfortable with the process and learn more about their personal tastes.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the concept of CSS frameworks

* Build web pages using pre-built Bootstrap UI components

* Optimize page layouts using Bootstrap's responsive grid system and utility classes

* Customize pages built with Bootstrap to use custom color themes and Google Fonts

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: CSS Frameworks (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Remind students that this unit is all about using third-party APIs and libraries to make our development work easier at times.

* Ask the students the following question: 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What purpose does jQuery serve?

    * üôã It is a library that can make working with the DOM a little easier at times.

* Explain that in this class, we will learn about a CSS framework called **Bootstrap**.

* Liken Bootstrap to jQuery, but for CSS instead of JavaScript. 

* Explain that Bootstrap is what's known as a **CSS Framework**, and is essentially a very large stylesheet that offers a lot of solutions for our layout and design needs that reduces the need for developers to create so much custom CSS for their apps.

* Ask the students the following question: 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we learn about getting started using Bootstrap?

    * üôã By visiting the documentation!

* Open the [Bootstrap web site](https://getbootstrap.com) and then select the "Get Started" button to open the documentation.

* Walk through the "Quick Start" section of the page, explaining the CSS file and three JavaScript/jQuery dependencies. We don't always need the `<script>` tags for our app to work, but they're needed for certain offerings Bootstrap provides.

* Briefly touch upon how Bootstrap can be through of in three main solutions:

    * **Components:** Bootstrap offers prebuilt UI components that we can use in our apps such as form elements, alert dialogs, and navigation bars.

    * **Layout:** Bootstrap has a prebuilt grid system that allows us to create responsive layouts with ease.

    * **Utilities:** There is a series of utility styles that allow us to adjust a number of CSS properties such as margin, padding, colors, and sizing.

* Explain that all of this is built using CSS properties we already know, Bootstrap has simply done a lot of the work for us. All we have to do is learn how to apply their prebuilt CSS classes and we can use their styles!

### 2. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Components (5 min) 

* Open [11-Ins_Bootstrap-Components](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/11-Ins_Bootstrap-Components) in your browser and walk through each example:

    * üîë The main page uses Bootstrap buttons to link us to each component page.

    * üîë The Navbar page shows three (of many) variations that Bootstrap provides. Explain that the dropdown menu capability and responsive hamburger menu icon need three `<script>` elements we saw earlier.

    * üîë The Cards page shows two variations of a popular component called a Card. They can be used for a list of blog posts, products in a store, sidebar content, and a lot more.

    * üîë The Forms page demonstrates how form elements look using Bootstrap.

    * üîë Explain that Bootstrap layout and utility classes were used in each page to achieve a responsive centered layout with differing background colors.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Where can we go to learn more about each of these components?

    * üôã The Bootstrap documentation!

* Reiterate that whenever we use a new library, framework, or technology, it's best we familiarize ourselves with the documentation as much as possible.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 3. Student Do: Bootstrap Components (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [12-Stu_Bootstrap-Components](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/12-Stu_Bootstrap-Components).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

    ```md
    # Bootstrap Components

    In this activity you will work with a partner build a web page using only prebuilt Bootstrap UI components.

    ## Instructions

    * Be sure to work with your partner!

    * Open [the starter code](./Unsolved/index.html) and examine what's there first.

    * Using the [Bootstrap documentation,](https://getbootstrap.com) add the following components to match the image below:

    * Navbar

    * Jumbotron

    * Alert

    * Form

    * List (with badges)

    * Card (with a list, header, and footer)

    ![The solution shows a handful of Bootstrap components on top of one another to form a web page.](./solved-screenshot.png)

    ## üèÜ Bonus

    * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can do to further your knowledge:

        * Learn about how Bootstrap came to be and how CSS frameworks like it can be useful.

    * Check the [Solution](./Solved/index.html) after class and compare it against your own file.

    ## üí°Hint(s)

    * When in doubt, use the Bootstrap documentation and Chrome DevTools to breakdown the classes and styles used!

    ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Components (10 min) 

* Bring students back from breakout rooms.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with Bootstrap Components. (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è The documentation shows us exactly how each component can be used along with sample code.

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Since we don't know everything about it yet, it's easiest to copy and paste their sample code into your HTML and edit it to your needs.

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Some of the components, such as the dismissible Alert, rely on three JavaScript files Bootstrap provides in the "Get Started" section. 

* Open [12-Stu_Bootstrap-Components](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/12-Stu_Bootstrap-Components/Solved) in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * üîë Each component works by using classes that are defined in the Bootstrap stylesheet. Navigate to the card HTML in the file:

    ```html
    <div class="card">
      <h4 class="card-header">This is a card.</h4>
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's
          content.</p>
      </div>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">Cras justo odio</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Dapibus ac facilisis in</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Vestibulum at eros</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="card-body">
        <a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
        <a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
      </div>
    </div>
    ```

    * üîë Most of these classes need to work in unison to see the result in the browser.

    * üîë Some components also rely on HTML data attributes to work as well, such as the responsive hamburger icon navbar toggling the menu to open and close on click.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone take a look at how these styles are used in Chrome DevTools?

    * üôã You'll notice that it's all the regular CSS properties we already know, the team at Bootstrap just spent a lot more time planning it out for us.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã The Bootstraps docs are the best resource for understanding how to use the different components, but Office Hours is always a good time to review as well!  

* Answer any questions before introducing the next demo.

* Ask the class the following question to help transition to the next demo:

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Do we think we're making good use of space with this layout?

    * üôã Most likely not, we may want to create some left and right columns to help put more content higher up on the page.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Layout (5 min) 

* Open [13-Ins_Bootstrap-Layout](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/13-Ins_Bootstrap-Layout) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * üîë We can create a 12-column grid layout with Bootstrap classes

    * üîë We can even control what width they will be on different screen sizes and use justification and alignment classes to reposition them.

    * üîë The page margins are created using the `container` and `container-fluid` classes. `container` has a maximum width applied and `container-fluid` will grow with the page no matter how wide.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What CSS tool have we put to use in the past to achieve these types of layouts?

    * üôã Flexbox!

    * ‚òùÔ∏è And what other CSS tool did we combine Flexbox properties with to make a responsive page layout?

    * üôã Media Queries

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 6. Student Do: Bootstrap Layout (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [14-Stu_Bootstrap-Layout](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/14-Stu_Bootstrap-Layout).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

    ```md
    # Bootstrap Layouts

    In this activity you will work with a partner and use the Bootstrap documentation to update an existing web page to make better use of space by implementing layout properties provided by Bootstrap.

    ## Instructions

    * Be sure to work with your partner!

    * Using the [Bootstrap documentation for the Grid,](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/) add to the existing code in the [Unsolved file](./Unsolved/index.html)

    * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to build the layout. The result should look like this image:

    ![The solution shows a page layout with multiple rows and columns using Bootstrap's grid system.](./solved-screenshot.png)

    ## üèÜ Bonus

    * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

        * Use Chrome DevTools to demystify the CSS powering the grid.

    * Check the [Solution](./Solved/index.html) after class and compare it against your own file. 

    ## üí° Hint(s)

    * Don't forget to use the previous example as a guide to how the classes can be used!

    ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Layout (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with building layouts in Bootstrap? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Any element with a class of `col-*` needs to be a direct child element of an element with a class of `row`. This is the Flexbox parent/child relationship at work.

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Bootstrap uses a "mobile-first" responsive system, meaning `col-` is going to adhere to the smallest screen and up, then `col-sm`, `col-md`, etc., classes will help control the width of a column on different screen sizes. 

    * ‚úîÔ∏è We can have as many different Bootstrap layouts as we need on a page, including rows nested inside of existing columns to create a new 12-column grid.

* Open [14-Stu_Bootstrap-Layout](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/14-Stu_Bootstrap-Layout/) in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * üîë Every grid layout we create starts with an HTML element receiving a class of `row`, turns it into a Flexbox layout. Walk through this portion of the solution HTML to explain the column sizing and grid alignment with `align-items-end`:

    ```html
    <div class="row align-items-end">
        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <img class='img-fluid' src="https://placehold.it/1920x1080" alt="video placeholder" />
        </div>

        <div class="col-12 col-md-6">
            <h1>Welcome to the app.</h1>
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Perspiciatis, reprehenderit! Placeat quo
            necessitatibus porro corporis quasi architecto sit aspernatur inventore, perspiciatis nulla hic soluta ipsum
            ipsa sed iure dolorum! Tenetur? Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Ex voluptatem
            dolorum earum esse recusandae facere aliquam. Excepturi facilis sint nesciunt ipsa, eveniet facere in quidem
            voluptas exercitationem distinctio commodi laborum!</p>
            <button class="btn btn-primary">Learn more.</button>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```

    * üîë When we don't want to have a column take up the full width, we can center-justify the row's contents and set the column to be smaller on larger screen sizes.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What do the `-sm`, `-md`, and `-lg` in the class names do for us? 

    * üôã They instruct the columns to be different sizes on different screen widths using media queries.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Did anyone find anything interesting in the documentation that we didn't use here? 

    * üôã We can automatically size columns with simple `col` classes and reorder them, amongst many other things!

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã Use the Bootstrap examples provided in the documentation to give yourself a starting point, then continue to tweak the class names to try and configure different layouts. Having a good understanding of CSS Flexbox properties will ultimately be the best way to learn it too. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next demo.

* Ask the class the following question to help transition to the next demo:

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we make this more vibrant and less tight feeling?

    * üôã We can use custom CSS, or we can look at Bootstrap utility classes and see what's offered.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Bootstrap Utilities (5 min) 

* Open [15-Ins_Bootstrap-Utilities](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/15-Ins_Bootstrap-Utilities/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * üîë This is the same page as before, but we use Bootstrap utility classes to add some different colors.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we change the color of an HTML element without changing its existing style definition? 

    * üôã Add another class to it that defines that color style.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 9. Student Do: Bootstrap Utilities (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [16-Ins_Bootstrap-Utilities](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/16-Stu_Bootstrap-Utilities/).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

    ```md
    # Bootstrap Utility Classes

    In this activity you will work with a partner and use the Bootstrap documentation to take a Bootstrap form component and center it on the page to make it more visually appealing using utility classes.

    ## Instructions

    * Be sure to work with your partner!

    * Use the [Bootstrap documentation for utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) to add to the existing code in [Unsolved file](./Unsolved/index.html) so the result matches this image:

    ![The solution shows the form is centered on the page with a dark background.](./solved-screenshot.png)

    * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code. Read the comments carefully, as they will provide hints as to where you'll find your answer in the Bootstrap documentation.

    ## üèÜ Bonus

    * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

        * Make this application look more personalized! Open Chrome DevTools and update some of the more generic styles to use different colors or font sizes.

    * Check the [Solution](./Solved/index.html) after class and compare it against your own file.

    ## üí° Hint(s)

    * Don't forget to use the previous examples and activities as a guide to how the classes can be used!

    ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through rooms.

### 10. BREAK (8PM - 15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Bootstrap Utilities (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with using Bootstrap utility classes? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è The use of utility classes makes it so we don't have to make custom one-off classes for small tasks like spacing, positioning, or sizing.

    * ‚úîÔ∏è The resulting HTML has more classes listed, but each class serves a single purpose and can be reused for other HTML elements. 

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Proper sizing, spacing, and positioning can really make a big difference in how a page looks.

* Open [16-Ins_Bootstrap-Utilities](../../../../01-Class-Content/05-Week_Third-Party-APIs-dev/01-Activities/16-Stu_Bootstrap-Utilities/) in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * üîë We can center a page's content vertically and horizontally by making the page have a minimum height set to the height of the page and making it a Flexbox. Point out how this code works:

    ```html
    <div class="min-vh-100 d-flex align-items-center bg-dark">
    ```

    * üîë Bootstrap has a list of preset color classes for backgrounds and text, which can be helpful when needing some contrast on a page.

    * üîë The spacing properties for margin and padding can be extremely useful to create or remove space in areas instead of needing to use custom CSS.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Which class was used to center the content vertically on the page, `justify-content-center` or `align-items-center`?

    * üôã `align-items-center`, since the term "align" is used when adjusting Flexbox elements vertically in a row.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Where do we think Bootstrap falls a bit short and requires us to build custom styles?

    * üôã The colors are preset, so we would need to use our own if we wanted to change them.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã Again, the documentation for Bootstrap is the best source for learning what these classes do. Putting them to use in an HTML page and adjusting the classes will provide the most insight in how to learn how and when they should be used. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 min) 

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

    * üîë @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

    * üîë @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

    * üôã @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 13. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
    @TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS; TABBED
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: { ACTIVITY NAME } (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `@TODO TOPIC`. (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THIS }

    * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THAT }

    * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

    ```
