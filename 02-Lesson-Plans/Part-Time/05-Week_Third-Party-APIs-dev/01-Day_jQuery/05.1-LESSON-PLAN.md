# 05.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to jQuery

## Overview 

In this class, we will perform DOM manipulations students are already familiar with, except this time we'll be using the jQuery. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements` through `10-Stu_Event-Delegation`.

* Take a few moments before class to get familiar with the [jQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/), as students will rely heavily on it in class and may need help finding answers.

* Throughout the class, reiterate often that the DOM methods we have used previously like `document.getElementById`, `document.createElement`, and `Element.innerHTML` all have corresponding jQuery methods as well as a powerful selector feature, to select elements in the DOM.
  
* Students can get hung up on learning the correct syntax. Encourage them that the interface gets easier to understand with practice and time.

* If students continually question why they are learning jQuery, since we have already learned how to manipulate the DOM with vanilla JavaScript, it is due to the prevalence of jQuery on the web due to its long run of popularity. Also, how to learn new libraries and measure their benefits is an important skill to have.

## Learning Objectives

We will use jQuery to:

* Create and select DOM elements
  
* Assign content or styling to a DOM element 

* Append, prepend, and replace elements to the DOM

* Traverse the DOM through parent, child, and sibling elements

* Attach event listeners and their corresponding event handling functionality 

* Delegate events for elements that have been dynamically created

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: jQuery Introduction (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.
  
* Inform students that this unit is all about using third-party APIs and libraries to speed up development work which will enable you to create more faster.
  
* Explain that in this class, we will learn about a JavaScript library called jQuery.

* First developed in 2006, jQuery is still used in over 60% in all websites at the time of this report. This makes jQuery the most widely distributed JavaScript library by a large margin.

* Ask the students the following question: 

    * ☝️ Can anyone offer a guess as to what made jQuery so popular?

    * 🙋 Enables manipulating the DOM with a simple interface and a library of methods. Also `querySelector` wasn't introduced until 2013.

    * ☝️ Where do we get started learning jQuery?

    * 🙋 By visiting the documentation!

* Open the [jQuery web site](https://jquery.com/) and then select the "API Documentation" menu link to open the documentation and do the following:

    * Review the menu on the left of different categories of DOM manipulation methods.
    
    * In order to use these methods, we must first use the jQuery selector to choose an element to manipulate.
    
    * In the Selectors category, select Basic to see how jQuery selects elements with attributes like `class` and `id` as well as by the element name, such as `$("div")`.
    
    * Once an element has been selected, we can use the dot notation to invoke a jQuery method.
    
    * Go back to the main menu and select the CSS category for the `.css()` method.
    
    * Demonstrate the following code `$("someElement").css("background-color", "grey")`.
    
    * Use the examples in the documentation to see how the methods work.

### 2. Instructor Demo: jQuery Elements (5 min) 

* Open `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements/index.html` in your IDE and show the following:
  
    * Notice there is barely any markup on this page!
  
* Open `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements/index.html` in the browser and demonstrate the following:
   
    * ☝️ How did we render these elements to the page?
    
    * 🙋 We can create elements dynamically with jQuery. We can populate a list by looping through an array, then creating each element and attaching it to the webpage.
  
* Open `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements/index.html` in your IDE again and demonstrate the following:

    * We insert the jQuery CDN link with the `<script>` at the bottom of the `<body>`. 
    
    * We can find this link at [https://code.jquery.com/](https://code.jquery.com/). We chose the minified version of jQuery 3.5.1. 
    
* Open `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:
    
    * We can select the element by attribute like an `id` and create a jQuery object.
  
    ```js
    var rootEl = $("#root");
    ``` 

    * We can create a DOM element with angle brackets.
  
    ```js
    var titleEl = $("<h1>");
    ``` 

    * We can loop through an array and create a DOM element for each array element, add text content, and append the DOM element to the page.
  
    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < abilities.length; i++) {
        // Create a new `<div>` for each ability and add the text content
        var abilityEl = $("<div>");
        abilityEl.text(abilities[i]);

        // Add this new `<div>` to the abilities `<div>`.
        rootEl.append(abilityEl);
    }
    ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are the vanilla JavaScript functions that can achieve similar results?

    * 🙋 `document.createElement`, `document.querySelector`, `Element.textContent`, `Element.setAttribute`, `Element.className`, and `Element.style`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 3. Student Do: jQuery Elements (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_jQuery-Elements/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery Elements

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery documentation to create HTML elements dynamically using jQuery.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to [jQuery API Docs](https://api.jquery.com/) in your browser.

* Open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and examine the comments.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a blank web page.

  * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to create the various elements needed to append a quote by Carol Dweck to the page.

* The result should look like this image:

![A quote followed by the author.](./quote.jpg)  

## 💡 Hint(s) 

* Don’t forget to add jQuery to `index.html` before you begin.

* Only use jQuery methods! Do **NOT** use any of the following vanilla JavaScript methods: `createElement`, `textContent`, or `appendChild`.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:
  
  * How can we add event listeners using jQuery?
  
* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: jQuery Elements (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the jQuery interface? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ jQuery Selector `$("selector")`

    * ✔️ `.text()` and `.attr()`

    * ✔️ Append to the page using `append()`

* Open `02-Stu_jQuery-Elements/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We begin by using the jQuery ID selector, `$("#root")`, and assigning it to a variable `rootEl`.

    ```js
    var rootEl = $("#root");
    ```

    * We can use this variable, `rootEl`, to modify the `<div id="root">` with jQuery methods.
    
    * We can also create elements by placing the angle brackets around the element.

    ```js
    var authorEl = $("<p>"); 
    ```
    
    * 🔑 We can add text content with the `text()` method.

    ```js
    authorEl.text("~ Carol Dweck");
    ```

    * We can create an `<h1>` element for the quote text.

    ```js
    var quoteEl = $("<h1>"); 
    ```

    * We can assign a class using the `addClass()` method. 

    ```js
    authorEl.addClass("plain");
    ```
    
    *  We can add text content to the quote element with the `text()` method.

    ```js
    quoteEl.text("Love Challenges, Be Intrigued by Mistakes, Enjoy Effort, and Keep Learning.");
    ```

    * 🔑 We can also add class or any attribute with the `attr()` method.

    ```js
    quoteEl.attr("class", "fancy");
    ```

    * 🔑 We can append the quote element to the page with  `append()`.

    ```js
    rootEl.append(quoteEl);
    ```

    * We attach the author element to the quote.

    ```js
    quoteEl.append(authorEl);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the difference between `$("<div>")` vs `$("div")` in jQuery?

    * 🙋 `$("<div>")` creates a new `<div>` element. `$("div")` will select every `<div>` in the document and return them in an array.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [jQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/), look at examples, and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Click Events (5 min) 

* Open `03-Ins_Click-Events/index.html` in the browser and show the following:

    * 🔑 We can click each button to trigger a different response.
    
    * 🔑 All the elements were created dynamically, except the empty `<div>`. 
    
* Open `03-Ins_Click-Events/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and show the following statements:
  
    * We can use `ready()` to wrap the DOM manipulation statements to ensure the DOM is available.
    
    ```js
    $(document.ready(function() {    
    ```
    
    * 🔑 We attach the click event to the alert button.

    ```js
    alertButton.click(function() {
        alert("Hello World");
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We add the event handler, `alert("Hello World")`, to the callback function.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What other types of event listeners are there?

    * 🙋 Mouse, Key, Browser events, and more

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 6. Student Do: Click Events (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Click-Events/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery Click Events

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug the code for a password generator. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* As a frequent online shopper, I want to make sure my passwords for online stores are random, unique, and strong. So I want to utilize a Password Generator to create unique passwords for me to use!

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser.

  * When we click on the "Generate Password" button once, it should print a 15-character password on to the screen.

  * However currently only single characters are generated when the "Generate Password" button is double-clicked!

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and examine the code.

* Using the following questions to guide you, try to debug and fix the code:

  * Where in your code is the error happening?

  * What is the expected behavior of the code?

  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

* The result should look like this image after you click the button once:

![The input field and button are now followed by a random password of length 15](./solved-demo.jpg)

## 💡 Hint(s)  

* Research the [jQuery Docs on events listeners](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/) to find the method that will provide the operation we require.
  
## 🏆 Bonus 

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge:

  * What are alternative methods to add event listeners?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: Click Events (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with adding click events with jQuery? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `$(document).ready()` 
    
    * ✔️ Attach the click event

    * ✔️ Callback functions of event listeners are for event handling

* Open `04-Stu_Click-Events/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We add the `ready()` function to ensure the DOM is available.
    
    ```js
    $(document).ready()
    ```

    * 🔑 We attach the click event to the button element.

    ```js
    newButton.click(function() {
      passwordEl.text(passwordGenerator(15));
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We place the action in response to the click event, the event handler, in the callback function.
  
    * We set the length of the password to 15 by assigning this value to the parameter of the `passwordGenerator`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Do the password functions need to be inside the `ready()` function?

    * 🙋 No, since they are just logic and have nothing to do with manipulating the DOM.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [jQuery Docs on mouse events](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Form Elements (5 min) 

* Open `05-Ins_Form-Elements/index.html` in the browser and demonstrate the following:

    * 🔑 Open the browser console.

    * 🔑 Fill out the form and click 'Submit'. We see the form input logged in the console.

    * 🔑 We used jQuery to create the text input fields dynamically.

* Open `05-Ins_Form-Elements/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and show the following:

    * We can use `append()` to attach the first name text input field to its corresponding label. 
 
    ```js
    firstLabelEl.append(firstEl);
    ```
    
    * We can use `submit()` as the click event for the `<form>` element.
 
    ```js
    formEl.submit(function (event) {
    ```
    
    * We use the `event` to prevent the page refresh default action for the `submit` event.
    
    ```js
    event.preventDefault();
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Can we use the `submit()` event for other elements beside forms?

    * 🙋 No, `submit` can only be used with forms.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 9. Student Do: Form Elements (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Form-Elements/README.md.`

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery Form Elements

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery documentation to determine how jQuery handles forms using jQuery methods like `submit()` and `val()` to create a shopping list.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery Docs on Forms](https://api.jquery.com/category/forms/) in your browser.

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * As a busy working parent, I want to be able to quickly create a shopping list for groceries.

  * When I enter an item to the shopping list form, it should appear on the page in a list of shopping items.

  * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to arrange the form elements using jQuery methods and attach the form to the webpage.

  * Add the event listener and event handler on the `form` for the `submit()` event. 
  
  * Clear the form on form submission.

* The result should look like this image:

![A shopping list with several items.](./shopping.jpg)

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Prevent the default behavior of the `submit()` event.

* What jQuery form method can you use to retrieve the input field's data?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:
 
  * Change the order of how the items are added to the shopping list.
  
  * For example, if the item is added to the bottom of the list, now make it added to the top of the list or vice versa.

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research how to do it.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (8PM - 15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Form Elements (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Form Elements in jQuery? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `append()` 

    * ✔️ `prepend()` 
    
    * ✔️ `submit()`

* Open `06-Stu_Form-Elements/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * In the first part, we create the form, with a series of prepending and appending to the form and root elements.

    * 🔑 We attach the `<form>` to the root element using `append()`.

    ```js
    rootEl.append(formEl);
    ```

    * 🔑We attach the `<input>` to the `<label>` to create an association using `prepend()`.

    ```js
    formEl.prepend(labelEl);
    ```

    ```js
    labelEl.append(inputEl);
    ```
    
    * 🔑 We attach `submit()` to the `<form>` element.

    ```js
    formEl.submit(function(event) {
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are some differences between the `click` and the `submit` events?

    * 🙋 `submit` is used to post a form so can only be attached to form elements. `click` can be attached to any element. `submit` event is not strictly a mouse event whereas `click` is.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the supplemental material, read the [jQuery Docs on Forms](https://api.jquery.com/category/forms/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 12. Instructor Demo: DOM Traversal (5 min) 

* Open `07-Ins_Dom-Traversal/index.html` in the browser and demonstrate the following:
    
    * 🔑 We use traversal methods to select different elements and change the styling.
    
    * 🔑 We can travel down through the children elements or up through the parent elements.

* Open `07-Ins_Dom-Traversal/index.html` in your IDE and show the following:
    
    *  We notice the position of the empty `<div>` in the markup.

    ```html
    <div id="top"></div>
    ```

* Open `07-Ins_Dom-Traversal/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * From the empty `<div>`, we can select elements in the DOM tree. 
    
    ```js
    $("#top").siblings().first().css("border", "blue solid 2px");
    ```

    * We can chain methods together to combine searches.
    
    * We can use `css()` at each search to see which elements were returned.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the name of the method to traverse down one level to the descendant elements?

    * 🙋 `children()` 
    
* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 13. Student Do: DOM Traversal (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Dom-Traversal/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery DOM Traversal

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery DOM Traversal documentation to search the DOM for the requested elements in a game of Tic Tac Toe.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery Docs on traversing](https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/index.js) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * Add the statements that will accomplish the **three** requested actions noted by the `TODO:` in the comments. Read these instructions carefully and use the `HINT` provided if needed.
  
  * Starting from `<div id="root">`, use DOM traversal methods in jQuery to select all nine tic-tac-toe boxes and change the background to white for greater legibility.
  
  * Starting from `<div id="root">`, traverse down through the DOM tree and insert the "O" to block the "X" player from winning.
  
  * Starting from `<div class="item-c2">`, traverse up through the DOM tree and insert the "O" for the win. 

* The result should look like this image:

![The tic-tac-toe board shows "O" is victorious](./tic-tac-toe.jpg)

## 💡 Hint(s)  

* You are the "O" player. Place the "O" to block and win.

* Change the style of the element as you traverse through the DOM as a visual aid to track the current location. 
  
## 🏆 Bonus 

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * What are some alternative methods to traverse up and down the DOM tree? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: DOM Traversal (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with traversing the DOM with jQuery? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ `closest()`, `find()` traverse

    * ✔️ Method chaining

    * ✔️ `first()`, `last()`, `eq()` select

* Open `08-Stu_Dom-Traversal/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We use the `find()` method to search all descendant elements with a selector. Then we use the `css()` method to change the styling.

    ```js
    rootEl.find("li").css("background-color", "white");
    ```
    
    * 🔑 We can chain the methods together to combine searches. We can compartmentalize the search by row to make them more legible.

    ```js
    var rowThree = rootEl.children().last().children();
    ```
    
    * 🔑 We use `first()`, to select the first element of the set of returned elements. We use the `text("O")` to insert the text "O".

    ```js
    rowThree.first().text("O");
    ```
    
    * 🔑 We use `closest("div")`, to select all the ancestor elements that is a `<div>`.  

    ```js
    $(".item-c2").closest("div").children().children().eq(0).text("O");
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Which of the methods we used begins a search with itself?

    * 🙋 `closest()` 

    * ☝️ What is the utility of traversal methods?

    * 🙋 Allows selection of elements when using the selector is not possible.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the supplemental material, read the [jQuery Docs on traversing](https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Event Delegation (5 min) 

* Open `09-Ins_Event-Delegation/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

    * 🔑 We can create and render the letter elements when the "Display" button is clicked.

    * 🔑 We can click on the letters to place on the refrigerator.

* Open `09-Ins_Event-Delegation/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:  
    
    * 🔑 We must delegate the event listener to the parent element, `<ul>`, because the letters are not available when the `document` loads.
    
    ```js
    listEl.on("click", ".letter-button", function() {
        var fridgeMagnet = $("<div>");
        fridgeMagnet.addClass("letter fridge-color");
        fridgeMagnet.text($(this).attr("data-letter"));
        displayEl.append(fridgeMagnet);
    });
    ```

    * 🔑 We use `on()` to attach the `click()` event so we only listen for the event on the descendants with the class selector `.letter-button`.
    
    * 🔑 We retrieve the user's selection using `$(this)` and assign the text content to the letter's `data-letter` attribute. 
    
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Is it necessary to use the `on()` method instead of the `click()` method when delegating events?

    * 🙋 Yes, in order to leverage the `on()` method's extra feature that filters the descendant elements.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 16. Student Do: Event Delegation (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Event-Delegation/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# jQuery Event Delegation 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery documentation on Event Delegation to handle click events for a dynamically created button.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery Docs on Event Delegation](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/) in your browser.

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a Shopping List form. We can add grocery items to the shopping list by using the form.

  * When we click the `X` button next to a grocery item, it should be removed from the shopping list. 

  * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to use event delegation to target a parent element of the grocery items in order to handle the click event for the dynamically created buttons.
  
  * Clear the input field on submission. 

## 💡 Hint(s) 

* In the event handler, create a new list by removing the user's selection.
  
* Use the new shopping list to call the `populateList()` in the event handler.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * What are some alternatives to using jQuery? Discuss the merits with your partner. 
 
* You can read [You might not need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) to see some options to jQuery. 
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 17. Instructor Review: Event Delegation (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with event delegation? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Target the parent element

    * ✔️ `on()` 
    
    * ✔️ `data()` 

* Open `10-Stu_Event-Delegation/Solved/assets/js/script.js`in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 We can attach the `on()` event listener to the parent element, `<ul>` to listen for the click on the shopping list item buttons.

    ```js
    listEl.on("click", "button", function() { 
    ```

    * 🔑 In the event handler, we use `$(this)` to select the button clicked by the user. 

    ```js
    var removeItem = $(this).attr("data-id");
    ```

    * 🔑 We use `attr("data-id")` to retrieve the value of the attribute, `data-id`, to identify the shopping item.
     
    ```js
    removeItem = parseInt(removeItem);
    ```

    * We can create a new list by placing all the elements in a new array except the one selected by the user.

    ```js
    var newList = [];
    for(var i = 0; i < shoppingList.length; i++) {
      if(removeItem !== i) {
        newList.push(shoppingList[i]);
      }
    }
    shoppingList = newList;
    ```

    * We populate the new list with the `populateList()` function.

    ```js
    populateList(shoppingList);
    ```

    * We can clear the user input by setting its value to `""`.

    ```js
    inputEl.val("");
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Are there any drawbacks with event delegating to ancestor elements, for example `<html>`, since this element will always be guaranteed to load?

    * 🙋 Yes, all descendants of `<html>` that exist now or in the future matching the selector will fire the handler. Therefore it's best to select a parent closest to the target element to decrease the chances for errant function calls.

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to the supplemental material, read the [jQuery Docs on Event Delegation](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.
