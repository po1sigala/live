# 05.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to jQuery

## Overview 

In this class, we will perform DOM manipulations that students are already familiar with, except this time we'll be using jQuery. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements` through `10-Stu_Event-Delegation`.

* Take a few minutes before class to get familiar with the [jQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/), as students will rely heavily on it in class and might need help finding answers.

* Throughout the class, reiterate often that the DOM methods we have used previously like `document.getElementById`, `document.createElement`, and `Element.innerHTML` all have corresponding jQuery methods as well as a powerful selector feature, to select elements in the DOM.

* Students can get hung up on learning the correct syntax. Encourage them that the interface gets easier to understand with practice and time.

* If students continually question why they are learning jQuery even though they have already learned how to manipulate the DOM with vanilla JavaScript, tell them that it is due to the longstanding prevalence and popularity of jQuery on the web. Also, knowing how to learn new libraries and measure their benefits is an important skill to have.

## Learning Objectives

We will use jQuery to do the following:

* Create and select DOM elements.
  
* Assign content or styling to a DOM element.

* Append, prepend, and replace elements to the DOM.

* Traverse the DOM through parent, child, and sibling elements.

* Attach event listeners and their corresponding event handling functionality.

* Delegate events for elements that have been dynamically created.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-TxVbjIGv8jMD4pcEtjonVPs8qItpUNHUCfIGMAErxg/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Third Party APIs:** This unit is all about learning how to use tools and code built by other developers.

  * **What languages do we use to build web apps?**

    * We use HTML for content and structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for handling logic, interaction, and fetching data. 

  * **How do we interact with HTML and CSS using JavaScript?**

    * The document object model interface enables developers to interact with the application‚Äôs HTML and CSS using JavaScript.

    * Some of these interactions include the following:
      
      * Creating HTML elements.
      
      * Changing HTML content and attributes.
      
      * Binding listeners to execute a function upon a certain event.

  * **Is the DOM built into the JavaScript language?**

    * No, it's not! On its own, JavaScript is very limited. Luckily, the browser provides numerous application programming interfaces (APIs) that we can use in the JavaScript code.

  * **Are there APIs we can use that aren‚Äôt provided by the browser?**

    * The web is filled with tools that other developers have built and made available for you to use in your projects! These third-party APIs exist to help you carry out specific tasks that you can do yourselves with CSS or JavaScript but that might be too complex or time-consuming to do by hand.

  * **How can we learn to use and implement these APIs?** 
  
    * Because these APIs are provided by developers (like us!) of all different backgrounds, there is no one correct way to learn how to use them. 

    * What‚Äôs important is that you identify what problem an API solves for you and how to properly integrate it into your existing application.

    * You can try the following strategies to learn more about specific APIs: 
    
      * Read the official documentation and practice with the provided examples.

      * Reverse-engineer finished code to see how something was accomplished.

      * Build something from scratch.

      * Debug a broken app using Chrome DevTools.

      * And most importantly, ask questions.

* In this unit, we will learn how to integrate these third-party APIs with applications. Specifically, we'll learn how to work with jQuery, Bootstrap, Google Fonts, jQuery UI, and MomentJS!

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/index.html` in your browser.

  * üîë We are viewing the mini-project that we will be able to build this by the end of this unit.

  * üîë It is a web application to track the amount of money earned on projects.

  * üîë This page is built with minimal custom CSS styles, and most of the complex JavaScript is handled by jQuery, jQuery UI, and MomentJS!

* Demonstrate the following:

  * We can create projects and add them to a table.

  * We can see how much money we could make on the project based on the hourly rate and potential project completion date.

  * We can sort and remove projects as well.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning how to use third-party APIs in our applications. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We are continuing to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but in a different way.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Most application developers rely heavily on third-party tools and libraries like these, so it's important to learn how to use them.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: jQuery Elements (5 min) 

* Open `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements/index.html` in your IDE and show the following:
  
    * Notice there is barely any markup on this page!
  
* Open `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements/index.html` in the browser. Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):
   
    * ‚òùÔ∏è How did we render these elements to the page?
    
    * üôã We can create elements dynamically with jQuery. We can populate a list by looping through an array, then creating each element and attaching it to the webpage.
  
* Open `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements/index.html` in your IDE again and demonstrate the following:

    * We insert the jQuery CDN link with the `<script>` at the bottom of the `<body>`. 
    
    * We can find this link on the [jQuery CDN page](https://code.jquery.com/). We chose the minified version of jQuery 3.5.1. 
    
* Open `01-Ins_jQuery-Elements/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:
    
    * We can select the element by attribute like an `id` and create a jQuery object, as follows:
  
      ```js
      var rootEl = $("#root");
      ``` 

    * We can create a DOM element with angle brackets, as follows:
  
      ```js
      var titleEl = $("<h1>");
      ``` 

    * We can loop through an array and create a DOM element for each array element, add text content, and append the DOM element to the page, as follows:
  
      ```js
      for (var i = 0; i < abilities.length; i++) {
        // Create a new `<div>` for each ability and its text content
        var abilityEl = $('<li>');

        // abilityEl.textContent = abilities[i];
        abilityEl.text(abilities[i]);

        // `my-3` class adds margin on top and bottom
        abilityEl.addClass('my-3');

        // Add this new `<div>` to the abilities `<div>`.
        rootEl.append(abilityEl);
      }
      ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What are the vanilla JavaScript functions that can achieve similar results?

    * üôã `document.createElement`, `document.querySelector`, `Element.textContent`, `Element.setAttribute`, `Element.className`, and `Element.style`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_jQuery-Elements/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: jQuery Elements (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_jQuery-Elements/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìñ Create HTML elements with jQuery

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to be greeted with a quote by an author when I open the page.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the page dynamically displays a quote by an author and the author's name on load.

## üìù Note(s)

Refer to the following documentation: 

[jQuery API Docs](https://api.jquery.com/)

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![A quote followed by the author.](./Images/01-quote.png)  

---

## üí° Hint(s) 

* Don‚Äôt forget to add jQuery to `index.html` before you begin.

* Only use jQuery methods! Do **NOT** use any of the following vanilla JavaScript methods: `createElement`, `textContent`, or `appendChild`.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the preceding tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:
  
  * How can we add event listeners using jQuery?
  
* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer this question.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: jQuery Elements (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the jQuery interface? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the following prompts and talking points to review the key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è jQuery Selector `$("selector")`

    * ‚úîÔ∏è `.text()` and `.attr()`

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Append to the page using `append()`

* Open `02-Stu_jQuery-Elements/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * üîë We begin by using the jQuery ID selector, `$("#root")`, and assigning it to a variable `rootEl`.

      ```js
      var rootEl = $("#root");
      ```

    * We can use this variable, `rootEl`, to modify the `<div id="root">` with jQuery methods.
    
    * We can also create elements by placing the angle brackets around the element, as follows:

      ```js
      var authorEl = $("<p>"); 
      ```
    
    * üîë We can add text content with the `text()` method, as follows:

      ```js
      authorEl.text("~ Carol Dweck");
      ```

    * We can create an `<h1>` element for the quote text, as follows:

      ```js
      var quoteEl = $("<h1>"); 
      ```

    * We can assign a class using the `addClass()` method, as follows:

      ```js
      authorEl.addClass("plain");
      ```
    
    *  We can add text content to the quote element with the `text()` method, as follows:

        ```js
        quoteEl.text("Love Challenges, Be Intrigued by Mistakes, Enjoy Effort, and Keep Learning.");
        ```

    * üîë We can also add class or any attribute with the `attr()` method, as follows:

      ```js
      quoteEl.attr("class", "fancy");
      ```

    * üîë We can append the quote element to the page with  `append()`, as follows:

      ```js
      rootEl.append(quoteEl);
      ```

    * We attach the author element to the quote, as follows:

      ```js
      quoteEl.append(authorEl);
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between `$("<div>")` and `$("div")` in jQuery?

    * üôã `$("<div>")` creates a new `<div>` element. `$("div")` will select every `<div>` in the document and return them in an array.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [jQuery documentation](https://api.jquery.com/), look at examples, and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Click Events (5 min) 

* Open `03-Ins_Click-Events/index.html` in the browser and show the following:

    * üîë We can click each button to trigger a different response.
    
    * üîë All the elements were created dynamically, except the empty `<div>`. 
    
* Open `03-Ins_Click-Events/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and show the following statements:
  
    * We create references to the DOM elements we will work with first, as follows:
    
      ```js
      var alertButtonEl = $('#alert-btn');
      var themeButtonEl = $('#theme-btn');
      var lotteryButtonEl = $('#lottery-btn');
      var lotteryNumberEl = $('#lottery-number');
      var refreshButtonEl = $('#refresh-btn');
      ```
      
    * üîë We attach the click event to the alert button, as follows:

      ```js
      alertButton.click(function() {
        alert("Hello World");
      });
      ```

    * üîë We add the event handler, `alert("Hello World")`, to the callback function.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What other types of event listeners are there?

    * üôã Mouse, key, browser events, and more.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Click-Events/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Click Events (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Click-Events/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üêõ Password generator returns a single character only on double-click

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a user, I should be able to click the Generate Password button only once to retrieve the password, not twice.

* As a user, I should be able to generate a 15-character password upon click. 

## Expected Behavior

When a user clicks the Generate Password button once, a 15-character password is printed to the page.

## Actual Behavior

When a user double-clicks the Generate Password button, a two-character password is printed to the page.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Click on the Generate Password button once to see that nothing happens.

2. Double-click on the Generate Password button, and a single character password is printed on the page.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The input field and button are now followed by a random password of length 15](./Images/01-solution-screenshot.png)

---

## üí° Hint(s)  

* Research the [jQuery docs on events listeners](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/) to find the method that will provide the operation we require.
  
## üèÜ Bonus 

* If you have fully completed the preceding tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge:

  * What are alternative methods to add event listeners?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the preceding question.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: Click Events (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel adding click events with jQuery? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the following prompts and talking points to review the key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è We can click on the button just once.
    
    * ‚úîÔ∏è The password is the correct length.

* Open `04-Stu_Click-Events/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * üîë Because the `.on()` method will listen for any valid browser event, we can simply change it to say `click`, as follows:
    
      ```js
      passwordBtnEl.on('click', function () {
      ```

    * üîë We change the argument passed into `passwordGenerator()` to a value of `15` instead of `2`, as follows:

      ```js
      var newPassword = passwordGenerator(15);
      passwordDisplayEl.text(newPassword);
      ```

    * We create the variables first, then the functionality, then the event listener bindings. This approach ensures that everything exists before we put it to use in the JavaScript.
  
* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Could we listen for both click and double-click events on one element?

    * üôã Yes! We can use a second `.on()` to an element to attach another event listener. 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [jQuery docs on mouse events](https://api.jquery.com/category/events/mouse-events/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to send the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Form Elements (5 min) 

* Open `05-Ins_Form-Elements/index.html` in the browser and demonstrate the following:

    * üîë Open the browser console.

    * üîë Fill out the form and click Submit. We see the form input logged in the console.

    * üîë We used jQuery to create the text input fields dynamically.

* Open `05-Ins_Form-Elements/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and show the following:
    
    * We can use `.on('submit', ...)` as the click event for the `<form>` element and pass `handleFormSubmit()` as the callback function, as follows:
 
      ```js
      formEl.on('submit', handleFormSubmit);
      ```
    
    * We use the jQuery `.val()` method on form elements to retrieve the input values, as follows:

      ```js
      firstNameEl.val() 
      ```

    * Because there can be more than one checked item, we need to select the checked elements and store them in an array using the jQuery `$.each()` method, as follows:

      ```js
      var checkedEl = $('input:checked');
      var selected = [];

      // Loop through checked options to store in array
      $.each(checkedEl, function () {
        selected.push($(this).val());
      });
      ```

    * We can clear form elements by using CSS selectors and setting an empty string value to them, but the checkbox requires a different type of reset, as follows:

      ```js
      $('input[type="text"]').val('');
      $('input[type="email"]').val('');
      $('input[type="checkbox"]').prop('checked', false); 
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Can we use the `submit()` event for other elements beside forms?

    * üôã No, `submit` can only be used with forms.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Form-Elements/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Form Elements (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Form-Elements/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üìñ Implement a Shopping List Form

Work with a partner to implement the following user storys:

* As an online shopper, I want to be able to add items to my shopping list so that I can view them all in one place.

* As an online shopper, I want to be able to quickly add another item to my list. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the form can be submitted and the value in the input field is captured and printed to the page as a list item.

* It's done when the form's input field is cleared upon a successful submission.

## üìù Note(s)

Refer to the following documentation: 

[jQuery Docs on Forms](https://api.jquery.com/category/forms/)

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![A shopping list with several items.](./Images/01-solution-screenshot.png)

---

## üí° Hint(s)

* Prevent the default behavior of the `submit()` event.

* What jQuery form method can you use to retrieve the input field's data?

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the preceding tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:
 
  * How can we reset form elements using plain JavaScript?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research how to do it.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (8PM - 15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Form Elements (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with form elements in jQuery? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the following prompts and talking points to review the key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è The use of `.on('submit', ...)`

    * ‚úîÔ∏è `.val()` for getting and setting data
    
    * ‚úîÔ∏è Validating form submission

* Open `06-Stu_Form-Elements/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * üîë We attach the `submit` event to the form element using `.on()`, as follows:

      ```js
      shoppingFormEl.on('submit', handleFormSubmit);
      ```

    * üîë We can get the value entered in the form `<input>` by selecting it by its `name` attribute and using `.val()`, as follows:

      ```js
      var shoppingItem = $('input[name="shopping-input"]').val();
      ```
    
    * üîë If we click Submit and nothing is in the `<input>`, do nothing, as follows:

      ```js
      if (!shoppingItem) {
        console.log('No shopping item filled out in form!');
        return;
      }
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What are some differences between the `click` and the `submit` events?

    * üôã `submit` is used to post a form, so it can only be attached to form elements. `click` can be attached to any element. The `submit` event is not strictly a mouse event, whereas `click` is.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã We can refer to the supplemental material, read the [jQuery docs on forms](https://api.jquery.com/category/forms/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 12. Instructor Demo: DOM Traversal (5 min) 

* Open `07-Ins_Dom-Traversal/index.html` in the browser and demonstrate the following:
    
    * üîë We use traversal methods to select different elements and change the styling.
    
    * üîë We can travel down through the children elements or up through the parent elements.

* Open `07-Ins_Dom-Traversal/index.html` in your IDE and show the following:
    
    *  We notice the position of the empty `<div>` in the markup, as follows:

        ```html
        <div id="top"></div>
        ```

* Open `07-Ins_Dom-Traversal/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

    * From the empty `<div>`, we can select elements in the DOM tree, as follows:
    
      ```js
      $('#top').siblings().first().addClass('p-5').css('border', '#1bbc9b solid 2px');
      ```

    * We can chain methods together to combine searches.

    * We can nest selectors inside of jQuery methods, as follows:

      ```js
      $('#top').siblings().eq(4).append($('<li>Classmates</li>'));
      ```
    
    * We can use `.css()` at each search to see which elements were returned.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the name of the method to traverse down one level to the descendant elements?

    * üôã `.children()` 
    
* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Dom-Traversal/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: DOM Traversal (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Dom-Traversal/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

---

## üí° Hint(s)  

* There are multiple ways to accomplish a goal using method-chaining!
  
## üèÜ Bonus 

* If you have fully completed the preceding tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * What are some alternative methods to traverse up and down the DOM tree? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the preceding question.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: DOM Traversal (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel traversing the DOM with jQuery? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the following prompts and talking points to review the key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è `closest()`, `find()` traverse

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Method chaining

    * ‚úîÔ∏è `first()`, `last()`, `eq()` select

* Open `08-Stu_Dom-Traversal/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * üîë We use the `find()` method to search all descendant elements with a selector. Then we use the `css()` method to change the styling, as follows:

      ```js
      rootEl.find("li").css("background-color", "white");
      ```
    
    * üîë We can chain the methods together to combine searches. We can compartmentalize the search by row to make them more legible, as follows:

      ```js
      var rowThree = rootEl.children().last().children();
      ```
    
    * üîë We use `first()`, to select the first element of the set of returned elements. We use the `text("O")` to insert the text O, as follows:

      ```js
      rowThree.first().text("O");
      ```
    
    * üîë We use `closest("main")`, to select all the ancestor elements that is a `<main>`, as follows:

      ```js
      $(".item-c2").closest("main").children().children().eq(0).text("O");
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Which of the methods that we used begins a search with itself?

    * üôã `closest()` 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the utility of traversal methods?

    * üôã Allows selection of elements when using the selector is not possible.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã We can refer to the supplemental material, read the [jQuery docs on traversing](https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Event Delegation (5 min) 

* Open `09-Ins_Event-Delegation/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

    * üîë We can create and render the letter elements when the Display button is clicked.

    * üîë We can click on the letters to place on the refrigerator.

* Open `09-Ins_Event-Delegation/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:  
    
    * üîë We must delegate the event listener to the parent element, `<div id="buttons">`, because the letters are not available when the `document` loads, as follows:
    
      ```js
      buttonListEl.on('click', '.letter-button', function (event) {
        var displayLetterEl = $('<div>');

        displayLetterEl.addClass('letter');

        // get letter from clicked letter button's `data-letter` attribute and use it for display
        displayLetterEl.text($(event.target).attr('data-letter'));
        displayEl.append(displayLetterEl);
      });
      ```

    * üîë We use `.on()` to attach the `.click()` event so that we only listen for the event on the descendants with the class selector `.letter-button`.
    
    * üîë We retrieve the user's selection using `$(event.target)` and assign the text content to the letter's `data-letter` attribute. 
    
* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Is it necessary to use the `.on()` method instead of the `.click()` method when delegating events?

    * üôã Yes, to leverage the `.on()` method's extra feature that filters the descendant elements.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Event-Delegation/README.md`.

### 16. Student Do: Event Delegation (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Event-Delegation/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# üìñ Implement Shopping List Item Deletion

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an online shopper, I want to be able to remove items from my list.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when each item's Remove button can be clicked to remove its respective shopping list item. 

## üìù Note(s)

Refer to the documentation: 

[jQuery Docs on Event Delegation](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/)

## üí° Hint(s) 

* Use your knowledge in DOM traversal to select an element's parent.
  
* The jQuery method for deleting an element is `.remove()`.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the preceding tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * What are some alternatives to using jQuery? Discuss the merits with your partner. 
 
* You can read [this guide to whether you need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) to see some alternatives to jQuery. 

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 17. Instructor Review: Event Delegation (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with event delegation? (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use Office Hours to get extra help!

* Use the following prompts and talking points to review the key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Event delegation

    * ‚úîÔ∏è `event.target` is the button clicked
    
    * ‚úîÔ∏è `.parent()`

* Open `10-Stu_Event-Delegation/Solved/assets/js/script.js`in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * üîë We can attach the `on()` event listener to the parent element, `shoppingListEl`, to listen for the click on the shopping list item buttons, as follows:

      ```js
      shoppingListEl.on('click', '.delete-item-btn', handleRemoveItem);
      ```

    * üîë In the event handler, we use `$(event.target)` to select the button clicked by the user, as follows:

      ```js
      var btnClicked = $(event.target);
      ```

    * üîë We use traversing with `.parent('li')` to select the first parent element that matches a `<li>` and remove it, as follows:
     
      ```js
      btnClicked.parent('li').remove();
      ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Are there any drawbacks with event delegating to ancestor elements&mdash;for example, `<html>`, because this element will always be guaranteed to load?

    * üôã Yes, all descendants of `<html>` that exist now or in the future matching the selector will fire the handler. Therefore it's best to select a parent closest to the target element to decrease the chances for errant function calls.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã We can refer to the supplemental material, read the [jQuery docs on event delegation](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.
