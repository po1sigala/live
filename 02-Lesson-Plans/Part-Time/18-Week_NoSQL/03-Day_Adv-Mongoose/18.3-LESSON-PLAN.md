# 18.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Mongoose

## Overview

This lesson plan will cover the creating computed properties in Mongoose with something called a virtual property. You will also cover populating a sub document in Mongoose after it has been created. Finally, you will go through the various create, read, update, and delete operations that you can perform on a Mongoose document.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Stu_Aggregates` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Students might find it difficult to understand the difference between data that gets stored in the database, and information that gets computed on the fly using virtual properties. Be sure to read the [Mongoose Virtual Properties Documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#virtuals_virtuals) prior to class to ensure that help teach students the difference between the two.

* Most activities in this lesson will require students to run the seed script by running `npm run seed` or `yarn seed` in the terminal inside the `Unsolved` directory for each activity.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain and execute CRUD methods with MongoDB

* Configure Heroku for deployment of a Node.js application using MongoDB

* Implement a Mongoose virtual property to create computed properties that are not stored in the database

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

<!-- TODO come back and review this -->
* Welcome students to class and explain the purpose of today's lesson.

* Congratulate students on their hard work and explain where MongoDB fits in the bigger picture as we move into the MERN stack.

* As your application grows in size and you ideas become more ambitious, you'll need to scale your application. MongoDB is a great fit for this. The nice thing about MongoDB is that the time to get your database up and running is significantly reduced when compared to a relational database. This is because MongoDB is schema-less, meaning that you don't have to define the structure of your database in advance. This means that you can add and remove fields without having to change your application. That said, it's important to note that MongoDB is not a replacement for relational databases. With Mongoose you can still use the relational database's features, such as foreign keys, relationships, and indexes.

* Along with Heroku, today we will be taking advantage of the free MongoDB Atlas service to help us deploy our database remotely. The free tier we will be using is perfect our our small application, however if we wanted we could set up our server to automatically scale using proactive or reactive scaling. When transaction times are high, or errors are common, we can use the MongoDB Replica Set to help us scale.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Virtuals (5 min)

* Open [21-Ins_Virtuals/server.js](../../01-Activities/18-NoSQL/21-Ins_Virtuals/server.js) in your IDE.

* Run `npm seed && npm start` from the command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In this demo, we will be using virtuals to create computed properties that are not stored in the database.

  * First let's review the folder structure of this application:

    ```sh
    .
    ├── config
    │   └── connection.js
    ├── controllers
    │   ├── commentController.js
    │   └── postController.js
    ├── models
    │   ├── Comment.js
    │   ├── Post.js
    │   └── index.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── routes
    │   ├── api
    │   │   ├── commentRoutes.js
    │   │   ├── index.js
    │   │   └── postRoutes.js
    │   └── index.js
    ├── server.js
    ├── utils
    │   ├── data.js
    │   └── seed.js
    └── yarn.lock
    ```

    * To keep things organized, we broke up our code into multiple files. In our server file you can see that we import our database connection and our routes at the top:

      ```js
      const express = require('express');
      const db = require('./config/connection');
      const routes = require('./routes');

      const PORT = 3001;
      const app = express();

      app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));
      app.use(express.json());
      app.use(routes);

      db.once('open', () => {
        app.listen(PORT, () => {
          console.log(`API server running on port ${PORT}!`);
        });
      });
      ```

    * Similarly, we created a central `index.js` file for our `api/`, `models/`, and `controllers/` to keep things organized.

    * Now that we have an understanding of the folder structure, let's take a look at our `models` folder and dive into the main concept for this demo - virtuals.

* Open `21-Ins_Virtuals/models/Post.js` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * Virtuals are a way to create computed properties that are not stored in the database.

  * Virtuals also allow the user of your API a way to get computed properties from the server without having to write front end logic to calculate them.

  * The example used in this demo is a computed property that calculates the number of comments on a post.

  * Our postSchema has the following properties:

    ```js
    const postSchema = new Schema(
      {
        text: String,
        username: String,
        comments: [{ type: Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'comment' }],
      },
      {
        toJSON: {
          virtuals: true,
        },
        id: false,
      }
    );
    ```

  * To create a virtual property, we use the `virtual` method and pass in the name of the property we want to create. In this case, we want to create a property called `commentCount` that will return the number of comments on a post.

  * We then define a getter function that returns the value of the property we want to create.

  * Virtuals are defined in the `Post` model as follows:

    ```js
    postSchema.virtual('commentCount').get(function () {
      return this.comments.length;
    });
    ```

  * We can then access the property in our `Post` model as follows:

    ```js
    post.commentCount;
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We could build a virtual property in our model by using the `virtual` method and passing in the name of the property we want to create. The `get` method is then used to define the getter function which will return the computed property.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Virtuals/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Virtuals (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  @TODO ADD ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS, TABBED ONCE OR TWICE (DEPENDING ON CODE SNIPPETS IN ACTIVITY INSTRUCTIONS)
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.
