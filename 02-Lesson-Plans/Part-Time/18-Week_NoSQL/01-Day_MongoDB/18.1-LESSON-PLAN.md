# 18.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: MongoDB

## Overview

In this lesson, you will introduce students to NoSQL databases and teach them how to execute CRUD functions using MongoDB commands. Embedded documents and MongoDB skip, sort, and limit methods will also be explored.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Compass` through `10-Stu_Sort-Skip`.

* Be sure to have MongoDB and Compass installed on your machine before class. Refer to the [MongoDB Compass docs on interacting with data](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/current/manage-data/) for details on how to connect and work with data with Compass. 

* MongoDB Compass is a powerful GUI that is used in today's lesson to help students explore data visually. Refer to the [MongoDB Compass docs on interacting with data](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/current/manage-data/) for details on how to connect to a local MongoDB host and work with data with Compass. 

* Today's activities do not have a frontend and all routes will be tested using Insomnia. Please make sure you have Insomnia installed locally prior to class. Refer to [Insomnia installation docs](https://insomnia.rest/download) as needed.

* While MongoDB may be new to most learners, today's activities build on skills developed in prior units including Express servers, SQL databases, data management, and queries. Where possible, encourage students to make connections to prior learning and start thinking of the role databases such as MongoDB play in their apps.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Create and manipulate data using MongoDB Compass

* Insert, find, and return documents stored within a MongoDB database

* Update and delete documents stored in MongoDB database

* Explain how embedded documents can be used to create one-to-one and one-to-many relationships

* Limit, sort, and skip documents using MongoDB methods

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tsxce_ukQswTyiPlxV9BfzshLkwquUHWdxNrFQYlHvM/edit#slide=id.g3fd172e150_2_21) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **What is NoSQL?**: NoSQL is an umbrella term for any database that is not a traditional, relational SQL database. There are four main types of NoSQL databases: document databases, graph databases, key-value stores and column-oriented databases.

  * **How do NoSQL databases store data?**: While NoSQL databases are all non-relational, each NoSQL database stores data very differently and are used differently by developers. In this unit, we will focus on MongoDB, a general purpose, NoSQL, document database that uses documents to store data and works great with JavaScript because it stores data in objects.
  
  * **How does MongoDB store data differently from SQL databases?**: SQL uses rows and tables to store data enforcing a rigid schema. Since SQL is a relational database, SQL also relies on joins to combine related data from different tables.

  * **How is MongoDB different? MongoDB uses documents and objects instead of tables and rows**: MongoDB stores data in objects stored in a format called BSON, or Binary JSON. BSON looks and acts just like JSON, but is optimized for faster parsing.

  * **How is MongoDB different? Groups of documents are stored in collections**: Unlike SQL tables, collections do not have an enforced schema to limit the type of data stored. Each document in a collection can have different fields (keys) and can contain different types of data.

  * **How is MongoDB different? Related data can be stored in embedded documents**: Unlike SQL, related data in MongoDB is not split between tables. Instead, related data is nested within a single object as an embedded document.

  * **SQL vs MongoDB**: So let’s review how data is stored in SQL and MongoDB databases. SQL relationships are relational. MongoDB is a NoSQL, non-relational database document. Both SQL and MongoDB are databases. SQL enforces a rigid schema and uses tables, while MongoDB does not enforce a rigid schema and uses collections. In SQL, data is stored in rows grouped into tables. In MongoDB, data is stored in documents and a grouped into collections. SQL relies on joins to relate data while MongoDB uses embedded documents.  

* Navigate to `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in your command line and run `npm install` demonstrate the following:

  * Before we can query our database, we first need to insert using `npm run seed`.

  * In the console, we can see all the data that has been populated. We can query this inserted data using routes.

  * Next we run `npm start` to start the app on port 3001.

* Open Insomnia on your local machine to demonstrate the following:

  * We use the GET route `localhost:3001/api/students` to return a list of all of the student data in database as well as their associated grades.

  * In the data returned, we see that each `student` object is made up of key-value pairs and has multiple, related `assignment` documents embedded. This structure looks and functions just like the objects we have been working with in JavaScript.

  * We can also see in the returned data that each `student` object is contained of a group of objects called `students`. 

  * A MongoDB database can have one or more of these collections.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning how to use MongoDB, a noSQL database, to store our data.

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We learned how to create a JavaScript object in Unit 3. We have also learned how to use and query a database using SQL in Unit 12 and how to create routes to perform CRUD operations with Express in Unit 11. MongoDB builds off of all of these skills.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 MongoDB is a popular, NoSQL database solution for companies large and small. MongoDB is also the `M` in two popular technology stacks -- `MERN` and `MEAN` -- that are used by developers to create easily scalable, fullstack apps. We will learn more about the `MERN` stack in the weeks ahead and will also use MongoDB in your final projects. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Compass (5 min)

* With a MongoDB server installed locally and running, open Compass on your local machine to do the following:

  * 🔑 To work with our local MongoDB server, we first have to make a connection. By default, the local MongoDB instance runs on localhost with default port `27017`. We will use the default connection at `localhost:27017` to connect to Compass.  

  * Click on the `Connect` button under `New Connection` at the center of the screen.
  
  > Note: You do not need to paste a connection string in the text box since you are using the default setting. Simply click on the `Connect` button and proceed to the next screen.

  * At the top left of the Local screen under `host`, we see that a successful connection to the default `localhost:27017` has been made. 

  * The built-in MongoDB shell is located on the bottom left of the Local screen. Click on `MONGOSH` to open a new MongoDB shell.

* In the open MongoDB shell, do the following: 

  * 🔑 To create a database, we select the new database using the `use` command and give it a name. The `use` command performs two common functions. If the database already exists, the `use` command selects the existing database for use. If the database does not yet exist, `use` creates the database as well as selects it for use.

  * To create a new `shelterDB` database, we enter `use` followed by the name of the database, `shelterDB` after the prompt. 

    ```sh
    use shelterDB;
    ```

  * 🔑 Data in MongoDB databases is stored in one or more collections. Just like when we create a database, we do not have to use a special command to create the collection. Instead, we can simply give the new collection a name and insert data in a single step.

    * We start our command with `db.` This `db` refers to the current database in use. We then use dot notation to enter the name of the collection we want to use. Since `petCollection` doesn't exist yet, it will be automatically created when our command is executed.

    * Next, we add the `insertOne()` method to insert a single document into our new collection, `petCollection`.

      ```sh
      db.petCollection.insertOne();
      ```

  * 🔑 Before we can execute the command, though, we must add our document's data. We define an object that contains the fields and values that we want to store and pass the object into `insertOne()`.

    ```sh
    db.petCollection.insertOne({ pet: "dog", breed: "chihuahua"});
    ```

  * Now that our command is complete and contains the data we want to insert, we click `enter` to execute the command. 

  * When a document has been successfully created, an object is returned. If we have not explicitly included a value for the `_id` field, the inserted ID that MongoDB creates for us is included in this object. 

    ```sh
    { 
     acknowledged: true,
     insertedId: ObjectId("{Unique-ID-String-Here}") 
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 To fetch the document we just created, we use the same syntax with the `find()` method. Notice that when our new document is returned, an `_id` has been inserted into the document.

    ```sh
    db.petCollection.find();
    ```

* Scroll up to the top of the page, and do the following to explore our data using Compass's interface:

  * When we click on the `Refresh` located the top of the Compass screen underneath `Local`, the `shelterDB` database we just created should appear on the list of available databases. 

  * We click on the arrow to the left of the `shelterDB` database to open it and click on the `petCollection` collection that appears below.

  * Once the `petCollection` is opened, the new document that we created appears in the Documents tab on the right of the screen. 
  
  * Using the visual interface we can explore, modify, and even delete the data using the `Find` and edit buttons on the page. In the next steps, we will learn to perform these CRUD operations within our app.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we create a new database and insert data?

  * 🙋 To create a new database we use the `use` command followed by the name of the new database we want to create. To add data, we first must define a collection to hold that data within the database. Then, we use an insert method to add our new data object into the collection. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Compass/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Compass (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Compass/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  # 📖 Creating and Viewing Data With MongoDB Compass

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to create a MongoDB database to store data.

  * As a developer, I want to add a collection to my database and insert a document so that I can visually explore that data using MongoDB Compass. 

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I click the `Connect` button to navigate to the Compass home page.

  > Note: You do not have to paste a connection string before clicking 'Connect`.

  * It's done when I have created a new local database named `inventoryDB` using Compass's Embedded MongoDB Shell (MongoSH).

  * It's done when I have added a new collection named `bookCollection`, inserted a field called `title`, and provided a value for the `title` field.

  * It's done when I refresh the page and the `inventoryDB` appears on the list of databases.

  * It's done when I open the `bookCollection` collection and the document I just created is visible on the Documents tab and an `_id` field has been automatically inserted.

  * It's done when I have modified the existing document, added a new field called `author`, and provided a value for the `author` field.

  ## 💡 Hints

  * What shell command do you use to create a new database?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How can you perform create, insert and delete operations in bulk using MongoDB? When would this be useful? 

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Compass (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Compass? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ MongoDB Shell in Compass

  * ✔️ insertOne()

  * ✔️ find()

* Open Compass on your local machine to do the following:

  * 🔑  With MongoDB server installed and running locally, we use the default connection at `localhost:27017` to connect to Compass by clicking on the `Connect` button. 

  * On the Local screen, scroll to the bottom and click on `MONGOSH` to open an embedded MongoDB shell. We will use this shell to enter our commands.

* Open the MongoDB shell to do the following: 

  * 🔑 To create a database, we select the new database using the `use` command and give it the name `inventoryDB`.

    ```sh
    use inventoryDB;
    ```

    * We use the `insertOne()` method to insert a single document into our new collection, `bookCollection`. In the next step, we will define the data for our new document.

    ```sh
    db.bookCollection.insertOne();
    ```

  * 🔑 To add our data, we define an object that contains the fields and values that we want to store and pass the object into our `insertOne()`. Then we click `enter` to insert the data.

    ```sh
    db.petCollection.insertOne({ title: "Hello World: The Real Story"});
    ```

  * When a document has been successfully created, an object is returned. If we have not explicitly included a value for the `_id` field, the inserted ID that MongoDB creates is included in this object.

    ```sh
    { 
     acknowledged: true,
     insertedId: ObjectId("{ID-STRING-APPEARS-HERE}") 
    }
    ```

  * It is important to note that `insertOne()` method is only one of the ways to insert data with MongoDB. We can also use `insert()` to add single or multiple documents or `insertMany()` to add an array of documents.

  * 🔑 We can also fetch our new document in various ways. One way is to simply use the `find()` method. This will return all the documents currently in our collection.

      ```sh
    db.bookCollection.find();
    ```

  * 🔑 We can also use the `find()` method and pass in an empty object `{}`. Since the filter contains no data, this will return all the documents in the collection. 

    ```sh
    db.bookCollection.find({});
    ```

  * 🔑 To fetch the only document we just created, we use the `find()` method and pass in a filter. This will return only the documents currently in our collection that match the data in the filter. Using a filter is a useful way to limit the amount of documents returned to only those you actually need.
  
    ```sh
    db.bookCollection.find({ title: "Hello World: The Real Story"});
    ```

* Click on the `Refresh` at the top of the Compass screen to demonstrate the following: 

  * When we click on the `Refresh` at the top of the Compass screen and the `inventoryDB` database we just created should appear on the list of available databases. 

  * We click on the arrow to the left of the `inventoryDB` database to open it and click on the `bookCollection` collection that appears below. 

  * The new document that we created appears in the Documents tab.
  
  * Using the visual interface we can modify the existing document, add a new field called `author`, and provide a value for the `author` field.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What CRUD function does the `insertOne()` method perform?

  * 🙋 The `insertOne()` method is used to create a single, new document. 

  * ☝️ What CRUD function does the `find()` method perform?

  * 🙋 The `find()` method reads data.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MongoDB docs on introduction to MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/introduction/), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Create-Read (5 min) 

* Navigate to `03-Ins_Create-Read/` from the command line and run `npm install` and `node server`.

* Open Insomnia on your local machine to demonstrate the following:

  * We can use `find()` and `insertOne()` methods in our Express routes to create and read data from our MongoDB database. 

  * To create a new document we create a `POST` request and add the url `localhost:3001/create`.

  * We then add the data we want to insert as a JSON object and click `Send` to insert our data.  

    ```json
    {
	    "name": "Mickey",
	    "breed": "chihuahua"
    }
    ```

  * In the returned data, we see our new document includes an `_id` field. 

  * To read the new document we just created from our database, we make a `GET` request and add the url `localhost:3001/read` and click `Send`.

  * Our new document, including the `_id` field with the same value, is returned. If our collection contains any other documents, those documents will be returned as well.

* Open `03-Ins_Create-Read/` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * The `POST` route we tested with Insomnia uses `insertOne()` to add a single document with a `name` and a `breed` field to the `petCollection`.

    ```js
    app.post('/create', (req, res) => {
      db.collection('petCollection').insertOne(
        { name: req.body.name, breed: req.body.breed },
        (err, results) => {
          if (err) throw err;
          res.json(results);
        }
      );
    });
    ```

  * The `GET` route we tested uses `find()` to retrieve all the documents from the `petCollection`.

    ```js
    app.get('/read', (req, res) => {
      db.collection('petCollection')
      .find()
      .toArray((err, results) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        res.send(results);
      });
    });
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we perform create and read operations on a MongoDB database using Express routes?

  * 🙋 We use the MongoDB methods `insertOne()` and `find()` to create a new document and read all the documents in a collection, respectively.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Create-Read/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Create-Read (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Create-Read/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is Atomicity? Why is it important to understand when performing write operations with MongoDB?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Create-Read (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with creating and reading data with a MongoDB database? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `require('mongodb').MongoClient`

  * ✔️ `mongodb://localhost:27017/inventoryDB`

  * ✔️ `mongodb.connect()`

  * ✔️ `collection()`

  * ✔️ `insertOne()`

  * ✔️ `find()`

* Open `04-Stu_Create-Read/Solved/server.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 To integrate MongoDB into an existing Express server, we install the mongodb package with `npm install mongodb` and require mongodb and MongoClient class in our `server.js` file.

    ```js
    const mongodb = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
    ```

  * 🔑 We connect to a local instance of MongoDB including database name using `mongodb://localhost:27017/` and append the database name.

    ```js
    const connectionStringURI = `mongodb://localhost:27017/inventoryDB`;
    ```

  * We declare a variable to store our connection.

    ```js
    let db;
    ```

  * 🔑 We then use the `db` variable to creates a connection to a MongoDB instance and returns the reference to the database

    ```js
    mongodb.connect(
      connectionStringURI,
      (err, client) => {
        db = client.db();
        app.listen(port, () => {
          console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
        });
      }
    )
    ```

  * 🔑 Once MongoDB is integrated into the server, we can use MongoDB methods to perform CRUD operations -- such as create and read -- using MongoDB methods.

  * To create a `POST` request, we start by creating a `POST` route. 

    ```js
    app.post('/create', (req, res) => {}
    ```

  * Inside the request, we add our query. We use `collection()` to create or select an instance of a collection and `insertOne()` to add a single document. We also add handling for both and errors and the results.

    ```js
    db.collection('bookCollection').insertOne(
      { title: req.body.title, author: req.body.author },
      (err, results) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        res.json(results);
      }
    );
    ```

  * To create a `GET` request, we use the `find()` method and use the `toArray()` method so multiple methods are returned in an array.

    ```js
    app.get('/read', (req, res) => {
      db.collection('bookCollection')
      .find()
      .toArray((err, results) => {
        if (err) throw err;
        res.send(results);
      });
    })
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
