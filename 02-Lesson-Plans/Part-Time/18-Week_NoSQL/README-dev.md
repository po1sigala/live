# Unit 18 Instructor Overview: NoSQL 

## Overview

In this unit, we will be introduce students to NoSQL databases and performing CRUD operations using MongoDB. Students will also learn to use Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, to enforce a specific schema on data and handle data relationships easily. Deployment of an application using Mongo Atlas and Heroku is also discussed. 

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/No-SQL/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Be sure to have MongoDB installed on your machine before the first class. Refer to the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) for instructions.

* MongoDB Compass is a powerful GUI that is used in this unit to help students explore data visually. Please make sure to download Compass prior to class. Refer to [MongoDB Docs on downloading and installing Compass](https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/current/install/) for details on how to install on Windows, macOS, and Linux environments.

* Mongo Atlas will be used to deploy the Mini-Project to Heroku. For instructions on how to sign-up for a free account, refer to [Get started free with MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register). No credit card is needed to register for an account. 

* Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. To use, make sure that you first have both MongoDB and Node.js installed. For start-up instructions refer to [Mongoose docs on getting started](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html)/

* This unit's activities do not have a frontend and all routes will be tested using Insomnia. Please make sure you have Insomnia installed locally prior to class. Refer to [Insomnia installation docs](https://insomnia.rest/download) as needed.

* While MongoDB may be new to most learners, today's activities build on skills developed in prior units including Express servers, SQL databases, data management, and queries. Where possible, encourage students to make connections to prior learning and start thinking of the role databases such as MongoDB play in their apps.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/No-SQL/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In Unit 19, students will learn about Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) and explore tools to improve both performance and offline capability. Refer to [MDN web docs on progressive web apps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) for more information on the PWA design pattern.
