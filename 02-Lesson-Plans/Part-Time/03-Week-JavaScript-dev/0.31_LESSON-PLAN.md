# 03.1 Lesson Plan: Introduction to JavaScript

## Overview 

This class introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, primitive types, comparison operators, and conditional statements. Students will also gain experience writing console logs and using the developer console in Google Chrome.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog` through `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements`.

* Take a few minutes before class to get familiar with the activities of the day and anticipate questions a student new to JavaScript may ask.  

* There is a lot of information in today's lesson that may be new to many students. If you find that the students are feeling overwhelmed, take a minute to point out that each activity builds on one another and they can look back at previous activities for guidance or reach out during office hours for help.

* At the beginning of today's class, the students will learn how to link an external JavaScript file and use the console. Please make sure to remind yourself of the various ways to open up [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on both Mac and Windows so you can help students navigate the process on their computers.  

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify and declare variables containing primitive data types

* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators

* Write conditional statements using if/else

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* This week, the students will take the first steps to build interactive websites using JavaScript.

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is JavaScript? 

    * üôã JavaScript is a scripting language that allows us to make web pages interactive. 

* Note that during class, they will write their first program in JavaScript.

* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Solved` in your IDE. Point out that the `index.html` look familiar but there is a new file, the `script.js`.

* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` in your browser and quickly note that the `index.html` file is just an HTML file. Then navigate to the console to show them Javascript at work. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Script and Console.Log (5 mins) 

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\index.html` in your IDE and note the following:

    * üîë `<Script>` allow us to write Javascript inside an HTML file

    * üîë The console log prints a message to the console

    * üîë To link an external Javascript file to HTML, `<Script>` is also used with one change.
         Inside the opening `<Script>` a src attribute is added with the path to the external file.        
      
* Run `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\index.html` in the browser and show the students how to navigate to the console in Chrome DevTools. Point out that both console logs appear. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the advantage of using an external JavaScript file? 

    * üôã It separates scripts from your HTML and CSS. It also makes your code easier to maintain. 

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Script-ConsoleLog\README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Script and Console.Log  (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Script-ConsoleLog\README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.


```md
# Adding Javascript to HTML 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use MDN Script Element documentation to link an external JavaScript file to an HTML file.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [MDN Web Docs: The Script Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) in your browser.

* Open [02-Stu_Script_ConsoleLog/Unsolved/index.html]() in your IDE and examine the code.

* Locate [02-Stu_Script_ConsoleLog/Unsolved/script.js]() in the same folder as the `index.html`. This is the external Javascript file you will link to the HTML. 

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given an HTML file that is not yet linked to an external Javascript file. We are also given a JavaScript file containing a pre-written console log to be linked.  

  * When we open the HTML file in the browser and go to the console, the message contained in the console log in the JavaScript file should appear. 

## üí° Hint

Use `Cmd + Option + J` on a Mac or `Cmd +Shift +J` on Windows to open up the Developer's Console on Chrome. Alternatively, right-click on the page and select `Inspect`.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Comments are a key part of a developer's toolbox.  Why do you think it is so important to include comments in your code? How do you write single-line and multi-line comments in Javascript?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```
* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through the room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Script and Console.Log (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with linking an external JavaScript file to your HTML?  (Poll via First of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è An external JavaScript file is linked to an HTML with `<script>`

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Inside the opening `<script>`, the src attribute's value is the path to the external JavasScript file

    * ‚úîÔ∏è The `console.log()` is a JavaScript function that logs a message to the console. The message is contained inside the `()`

* Open`01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html`  in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * When we use `<script>` tags to add inline JavaScript or to link to an external JavaScript file, it is best practice to put the tags just above the closing body tag. That is because all the HTML should load before the JavaScript file loads. 

    ```
        <body>
  
  	        <h1 style="text-align:center;">Open the Console to See the Magic ‚ú®! </h1>

  	        <!--YOUR CODE HERE-->

  	        <script src="script.js"></script>

	    </body>
	   
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How is a `script` tag used to add JavaScript to HTML files?  

    * üôã The `<script>` tag can be used to create inline JavaScript by writing code in between the opening and closing tags. The `<script>`tag when given an src attribute that equals the path to an external JavaScript file, links the HTML file to the external JavaScript page. 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ MDN Web Docs: The Script Element }]({ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script }), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Hello Variable (5 mins) 

* Open `03-Ins_HelloVariable/index.html` in your IDE and point out the following: 

    * üîë Variables are declared using `var`

    * üîë Each variable name should be unique.

    * üîë Variables can hold a variety of data types, not just text.

    * üîë Variables can be used in console logs to log their assigned value

   * üîë Variables and values can be concatenated in a single console log using "+"

* Run `03-Ins_HelloVariable/index.html` in the browser and remind students how to navigate to the console in Chrome DevTools. Point out that the values stored in the variables appear in the logs and that in the final log, `+` has been used to combine a variable with a value (a string). 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we create a variable named `pet` and give it a value of `"dog"`? 

    * üôã You would use `var` followed by the name of the variable, ie `var pet`. Then you would set it to value `"dog"`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 6. Student Do: Hello Variable (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_HelloVariable/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Hello Variable 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to write introductions in the console using console.log() and variables.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Unsolved/script.js]() to implement the following features:

  * As a class member, I want to input name, number of pets, and a fun fact about myself and log an introduction to the console. Then, by only re-assigning the variables, I want to introduce my partner.

  * When I store a name in a variable called `name`, then it should log this introduction line to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

  * When I store a number in a variable called `pets`, then it should log this introduction line to the console:  "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS` pet(s)."

  * When I store a fun fact in variable called `funFact`, then it should log this introduction line to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT`"

  * When I re-assign the values of `name`, `pets` and `funFact` with my new partner's information the the introduction lines above should reflect the new values.

* Open [04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Unsolved/index.html]() to implement the following features:

  * When I open the HTML file in the browser and go to the console, the logs should appear. 

## üí° Hint

The `+` sign can be used to combine text and variables in a single console log message.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you concatenate two variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: Hello Variable (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with creating a variable? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Variables are used to store data that will be used in your code

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Variables are declared with `var`

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Variables using `var` can be re-assigned to a new value 

   * ‚úîÔ∏è Use `+` to combine data and variable names in a single console log

* Open `04-Stu_HelloVariable/Unsolved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * A variable should only be declared once. To re-assign a variable, just use its name.   

    ```  
        // Declare variables using var
	var name = "Sakura";
	var pets = 3;
	var funFact = "I like pineapple on my pizza."

	// When re-assigning variables, use only variable name
	name = "Mateo";
	pet = 5;
	funFact = "I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."
 
    ```
* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è Can a variable's value be re-assigned? How? 

    * üôã Yes! A variable can store various types of data. To re-assign a variable, use the variable's name and set it equal to the new value.
    
  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web  Docs: Storing the Information You Need -- Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Primitive Types (5 mins) 

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/script.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  * üîë Primitive data types include undefined, string, number and boolean

  * üîë  A string is a series of characters and is surrounded by quotes 

 * üîë  A number can be either an integer or a decimal 

 * üîë  Booleans have two values: true or false

  * üîë To evaluate type, you can use `typeof`

* Run `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/index.html` in the browser and navigate to the console to show the students the console logs.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What primitive type has only two values? 

    * üôã A boolean has only two values: true or false. 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the only primitive type that must be surrounded by quotes?  

    * üôã Strings

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What primitive type would we use if we wanted to do simple arithmetic?

    * üôã Numbers

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 9. Student Do: Primitive Types (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/README.md`.

```md

# Primitive Value Types

In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer code to identify primitve value types.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [06-Stu_Primitive-Types/Unsolved/script.js]() to examine the code.

* Insert comments where specified to explain what is happening in that block of code.

## üí° Hint

JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic programming language. That means that in Javascript, a variable can store any data type. In addition, the type of data that a variable stores can change by simply reassigning the variable.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * There are two more primitive value types in JavasScript. What is BigInt and Symbol?  

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```
### 10. BREAK (8PM - 15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Primitive Types (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with primitive types? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Primitive value types include strings, numbers and booleans 

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Use `typeof` to test the type of a value. 

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Undefined is a primitive data type too. 

* Open `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * In JavaScript, you can change the type of value stored in the variable simply by re-assiging the value. This makes `typeof` a powerful debugging tool because it lets you easily check type to make sure you are getting the output you want. 

    ```
      // Reassigns variables
     four = "Hello!";
     five = false;
     seven = 23;

    
      // Logs string
      console.log(typeof four);

      // Logs boolean
      console.log(typeof five);

      // Logs number
      console.log(typeof seven);

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è How can you test the type of a value? 

    * üôã Use `typeof`.

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã Stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Logical and Comparison Operators (5 mins) 

* Open `07-Ins_Logical-Comparison-Operators/script.js` in your IDE and do the following:

  *  Read the sample instructions provided in the comments to the class. 

 
* Ask the class the following question (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is one step you can take when you come across an unfamiliar coding challenge?

    * üôã Before researching, break the challenge down into smaller bits of information to help formulate 'good' questions. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 13. Student Do: Logical and Comparison Operators (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Logical-Comparison-Operators/README.md`.

```md


```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: Logical and Comparison Operators (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with logical and comparison operators? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Logical operators include `&&`, `||` and `!` and test logic between values.

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Comparison operators include `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=`. These operators compare values.

    * ‚úîÔ∏è In Javascript, `=` is reserved. To test equality, use `==` or `===`.

* Open `08-Stu_Logical-Comparison-Operators/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * Double 

    ```
        

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What are comparison operators used for in Javascript?

    * üôã Comparison operators compare between values

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã Do a bit more research or stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 15. Instructor Demo: Conditional Statements (5 mins) 

* Open `09-Ins_Conditional-Statements/index.html` in your IDE and make comments on the code to point out the following:

  * üîë Conditional statements use comparison and logical operators to test values. Conditional statements evaluate to true or false.

  * üîë With an if-statement, if the statement evaluates to true, then the action after the curly brackets is performed.

  * üîë With an if/else statement, if the statement evaluates to true, the action after the curly brackets is performed. Else, the second action is performed


* Run `09-Ins_Conditional-Statements/index.html` in the browser and navigate to the console to show the students the console logs.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What happens if an if-statement evaluates to false?

    * üôã Nothing. The action after the curly bracket is not performed.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Student Do: Conditional Statements (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/README.md`. 

```md

# Conditional Statements

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create an algorithm using conditional statements. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Unsolved/script.js]() to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will take in two expressions and evaluate if both expressions evaluate to true, only one expression evaluates to true, or both expressions evaluate to false. 

  * If expression1 is true and expression2 is true, then log to the console: "True ‚úÖ True ‚úÖ"

  * Else if only expression1 is true, then log to the console: "True ‚úÖ False ‚ùå"

  * Else if only expression2 is true, then log to the console: "False ‚ùå True ‚úÖ"

  * Else, log to the console: "False ‚ùå False ‚ùå"

## üí° Hint

Don't code without a plan! Before writing your algorithm in Javascript, take a few minutes to talk with your partner and write out in everyday language what you need to do to make each line of code work. Then, using that plan, translate that pseudocode into your Javascript algorithm. 

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  What‚Äôs a switch case? How might it be used to build Ramona's app a different way? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.


```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 17. Instructor Review: Conditional Statements (15 mins)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with conditional statements? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Conditional statements are a great way to add decision-making into your code.  

    * ‚úîÔ∏è If-statements only execute if the condition is true.

    * ‚úîÔ∏è In an if/else statement, the if statement executes if the condition is true and the else statement executes if the if-condition is not met (it is false).

* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Unsolved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * In this example,  

    ```


    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between an if-statement and an if/else statement? 

    * üôã An if-statement only evaluates if the condition is true. An if/else statement provides a choice. If the statement is true, one block of code executes, else another block of code executes. 

    * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * üôã Stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.
