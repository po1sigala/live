### 8. Instructor Demo: Primitive Types (5 mins) 

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/script.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  *  In the previous activity, we learned to store values in variables. In this activity, we will take a deeper dive into  types of values that are stored in variables, namely the primitive types undefined, string, numbers and booleans 

  * A variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value has the type of undefined.

  ```
      var myUndefined;

  ```

  *  Strings should already look familar!  Values with the type string are a series of characters and is surrounded by quotes 

  ```

  ```

  * 🔑  In Javascript, a number can be either an integer (whole number) or a decimal. 

  ```

  ```

  * 🔑  Booleans are unique because they hold only two values: true or false

  ```

  ```

  * 🔑 Sometimes, developers want to check what type of value is stored in a variable. To evaluate type, you can use `typeof`

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/index.html` in the browser and navigate to the console to show the students the console logs.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What primitive type has only two values? 

    * 🙋 A boolean has only two values: true or false. 

    * ☝️ What is the only primitive type that must be surrounded by quotes?

    * 🙋 Strings

    * ☝️ What primitive type would we use if we wanted to store a decimal?

    * 🙋 Numbers

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 9. Student Do: Primitive Types (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md

# Primitive Value Types

In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer code to identify primitve value types.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [06-Stu_Primitive-Types/Unsolved/script.js]() to examine the code.

* Insert comments where specified to explain what is happening in that block of code.

## 💡 Hint

JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic programming language. That means that in Javascript, a variable can store any data type. In addition, the type of data that a variable stores can change by simply reassigning the variable.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * There are two more primitive value types in JavasScript. What is BigInt and Symbol?  

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```
### 10. BREAK (8PM - 15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Primitive Types (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with primitive types boolean, string, number and undefined? (Poll via Fist of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Primitive value types include strings, numbers and booleans 

    * ✔️ Use `typeof` to test the type of a value. 

    * ✔️ Undefined is a primitive data type too. 

* Open `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * In JavaScript, you can change the type of value stored in the variable simply by re-assigning the value. This makes `typeof` a powerful debugging tool because it lets you easily check type to make sure you are getting the output you want. 

    ```
      // Reassigns variables
      four = "Hello!";
      five = false;
      seven = 23;

      // Logs string
      console.log(typeof four);

      // Logs boolean
      console.log(typeof five);

      // Logs number
      console.log(typeof seven);

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How can you test the type of a value? 

    * 🙋 Use `typeof`

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: JavaScript Data Types and Data Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Logical and Comparison Operators (5 mins) 

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/script.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  * 🔑 Arithmetic operators combine with numbers. An arithmetic expression returns a single number.

  * 🔑 Modulus is an arithmetic operator used to find the remainder between two numbers 
  
  * 🔑 Comparison operators combine with strings, booleans. A comparision expression returns true or false
  
  * 🔑 Logical operators take in two or more expressions. Logical expressions return true or false

 
* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ Logical and comparison expressions evaluate to what primitive type? 

    * 🙋 A boolean! They evalute to true or false.
    
* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 13. Student Do: Logical and Comparison Operators (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Logical-Comparison-Operators/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md

# Logical Comparison Operators 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug some broken code so that all the console logs return true. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* As a developer, I want to use comparison and logical operators to create logs that only read true. 

* When I open the console, all the logs should read "true", but right now they do not!

* Open [08-Stu_Logical-Comarision-Operators/Unsolved/script.js]() and examine the code.

* Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
  
  * What is the current output for each console log?
  
  * How might you use a logical or conditional operator so the expression that the expression evaluates to true? 
  
  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

## 💡 Hints

You probably have already run into comparison operators in math class! 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is NaN? What happens when you use typeof to evaluate NaN? Is the answer what you expected? Why or why not?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: Logical and Comparison Operators (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with logical and comparison operators? (Poll via Fist of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Logical operators include `&&`, `||` and `!` and test logic between values.

    * ✔️ Comparison operators include `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=`. These operators compare values.

    * ✔️ In JavaScript, `=` is reserved. To test equality, use `==` or for strict equality `===`.

* Open `08-Stu_Logical-Comparison-Operators/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * In this example, the variable `a` has the type of string while variable `b` has a type of number. As a result, they are not strictly equal ``===`` and using `===` returns false.  However, since they have the same value, in this case `50`, using double equals `==` in the expression evaluates to true.

    ```
      var a = "50";
      var b = 50; 
       
      console.log(a == b);

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What are comparison operators used for in JavaScript?

    * 🙋 Comparison operators compare between values

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

   * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Expressions and Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Conditional Statements (5 mins) 

* Open `09-Ins_Conditional-Statements/script.js` in your IDE and make comments on the code to point out the following:

  * 🔑 Conditional statements use comparison and logical operators to test values. Conditional statements evaluate to true or false.

  * 🔑 With an if-statement, if the statement evaluates to true, then the action after the curly brackets is performed.

  * 🔑 With an if/else statement, if the statement evaluates to true, the action after the curly brackets is performed. Else, the second action is performed.
   
   * 🔑 If there are more than one statement to be evaluated, `else if` is used.

* Run `09-Ins_Conditional-Statements/index.html` in the browser and navigate to the console to show the students the console logs.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What happens if an if-statement evaluates to false?

    * 🙋 Nothing. The action after the curly bracket is not performed.
    
    * ☝️ What happens if `else` is added to the same if-statment that evaluates to false, making it an `if-else` statement? 

    * 🙋 The second action following the `else` is performed.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Student Do: Conditional Statements (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/README.md`. 

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md

# Conditional Statements

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create an algorithm using conditional statements. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Unsolved/script.js]() to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will take in two expressions and evaluate if both expressions evaluate to true, only one expression evaluates to true, or both expressions evaluate to false. 

  * If expression1 is true and expression2 is true, then log to the console: "True ✅ True ✅"

  * Else if only expression1 is true, then log to the console: "True ✅ False ❌"

  * Else if only expression2 is true, then log to the console: "False ❌ True ✅"

  * Else, log to the console: "False ❌ False ❌"

## 💡 Hint

Don't code without a plan! Before writing your algorithm in JavaScript, take a few minutes to talk with your partner and write out in everyday language what you need to do to make each line of code work. Then, using that plan, translate that pseudocode into your JavaScript algorithm. 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  What’s a switch case? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 17. Instructor Review: Conditional Statements (15 mins)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with conditional statements? (Poll via Fist of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution as to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

    * ✔️ Conditional statements are a great way to add decision-making into your code. 

    * ✔️ If-statements only execute if the condition is true.

    * ✔️ In an if/else statement, if the condition is true, the first block of code is executed. Else, the second block of code is executed.

* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Unsolved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

    * If/else statements are tested in order. If the first conditional statement evaluates to true then the first block of code is executed. Only if the first conditional statement evaluates to false is the second conditional statement tested. The process repeats until a conditional statement evaluates to true and its associated block of code is evaluated. If none of the statements evaluate to true, then the block of code following `else` is executed.

    ```
      if(expression1 && expression2) {
      console.log("True ✅ True ✅");

      // If both conditions are not true, check if expression1 is true
      } else if (expression1) {
      console.log("True ✅ False ❌");

      // If expression1 is not true, then check if expression2 is true
      } else if (expression2) {
      console.log("False ❌ True ✅");

      // If none of the conditions above evaluate to true, both expressions must be false
      } else {
      console.log("False ❌ False ❌");
      }

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What is the difference between an if-statement and an if/else statement? 

    * 🙋 An if-statement only evaluates if the condition is true. An if/else statement provides a choice. If the statement is true, one block of code executes, else another block of code executes. 

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web  Docs: If...Else](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.
