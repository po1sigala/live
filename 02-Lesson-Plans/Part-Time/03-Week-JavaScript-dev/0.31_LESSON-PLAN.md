# 03.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to JavaScript

## Overview

This class introduces the fundamentals of JavaScript including variables, primitive types, comparison operators, and conditional statements. Students will also gain experience writing console logs and using the developer console in Google Chrome.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog` through `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements`.

* Take a few minutes before class to get familiar with the activities of the day and anticipate questions a student new to JavaScript may ask.

* There is a lot of information in today's lesson that may be new for many students. If you find that the students are feeling overwhelmed, take a moment to point out that these are the building blocks of JavaScript and each activity builds on one another. They can look back at previous activities for guidance or reach out during office hours for help.

* At the beginning of today's class, the students will learn how to link an external JavaScript file and use the developer console in Google Chrome. Please make sure to remind yourself of the various ways to open up [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on both Mac and Windows so you can help students navigate the process on their own computers. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Identify and declare variables containing primitive data types 

* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators 

* Write conditional statements using if/else

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Inform the students that during today's class, they will take the first steps to build interactive websites with JavaScript. 

* Stress that JavaScript builds on skills they have already learned. HTML provides the structure for the webpage. CSS enhances HTML by providing styling, formatting and improving presentation. JavaScript is what makes webpages dynamic.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is JavaScript?

  * 🙋 JavaScript is a scripting language that allows us to make web pages interactive.

  * ☝️ What are some things that you can do with JavaScript?

  * 🙋 With JavaScript, you can store useful data and user inputs, manipulate HTML and CSS, play video and audio and much, much more.

* Tell the students that using the skills learned in class today, they will have the tools to implement one of JavaScript's key uses: decision-making using conditional statements. 

* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Solved/script.js` in your IDE.

   *  Assure students that it is okay if the code does not look familiar just yet. This is a just a preview of the decision-making code they will be able to implement at the end of class. 

   * Point out that the code is made up of a series of conditions that decide which message will log to the console. For example, in the code below, if this condition is met, `True ✅ True ✅` will log. 

   ```js
   if(expression1 && expression2) {
   console.log("True ✅ True ✅");
   ```

   * If not, the other conditions are tested. If none of the conditions are met, then `False ❌ False ❌` is logged.

   ```js
   } else {
   console.log("False ❌ False ❌");
   }
  ```

* Open `10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Solved/index.html` and navigate to the console to show them that a single message `False ❌ False ❌` appears indicating none of the conditions are met.  

* Assure the students that during class we will delve into this JavaScript code in more detail.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Script and Console.Log (5 mins)

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\index.html` in your IDE and note the following: 

  * In this HTML file, HTML and CSS are working together to provide style and structure to the page.

  ```html
  <h1 style="text-align:center;">Open the Console to See the Magic ✨! </h1>
  ```
    
  * There is also something new: `<script>` tags for JavaScript

  * Inline `<script>` tags allow you to write scripts directly in an HTML file.

  ```html
  <script>
  //Console logs write data directly to the console.
  console.log("This is the log for the 🔥INLINE🔥 JavasSript");
  </script> 
  ```

  * Adding an src attribute to the opening `<script>` tag allows you to link to an external JavaScript file

  ```html
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  ```

  * You should write your `<script>` tags above the closing `</body>` tag to make sure your HTML and CSS load first.

  ```html
  <body>
    <h1 style="text-align:center;">Open the Console to See the Magic ✨! </h1>

    <!--Inline script-->
    <script>
    //Console logs write data directly to the console.
    console.log("This is the log for the 🔥INLINE🔥 JavasSript");
    </script>

    <!--Link to external Javascript file-->
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>    
  ```

* Console logs are JavaScript functions that log messages to the console. The message is placed inside the parentheses`()`. this will log the message: "This is the log for the 🔥INLINE🔥 JavasScript."

```js
console.log("This is the log for the 🔥INLINE🔥 JavasScript");
```

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\script.js` in your IDE and note the following: 

  *  JavaScript looks and performs the same whether it is written inline or in an external file. This will log the message: "This is the log for the 🔥EXTERNAL🔥JavaScript."

  ```js
  console.log("This is the log for the 🔥EXTERNAL🔥JavaScript");
  ```

* Open `01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\index.html` in the browser and demo how to navigate to the console in Chrome Developer Tools. 

* Point out that both the console log from the inline JavaScript and external file appear as messages in the console.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do you link an HTML file to an external JavaScript file?
  
  *  🙋 Use `<script>` tags and set the src attribute to the path of the external JavaScript file.
  
  * ☝️ What does the console log function do?
 
  *  🙋 It logs a message to the console. 

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Script-ConsoleLog\README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Script and Console.Log (15 mins)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Script-ConsoleLog\README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.
 
```md

# Adding JavaScript to HTML

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use MDN Script Element documentation to link an external JavaScript file to an HTML file. 

## Instructions 

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [MDN Web Docs: The Script Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](02-Stu_Script_ConsoleLog/Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Locate [script.js](02-Stu_Script_ConsoleLog/Unsolved/script.js). This is the external JavaScript file you will link to the HTML.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

* We are given an HTML file that is not yet linked to an external JavaScript file. We are also given a JavaScript file containing a pre-written console log to be linked.

* When we open the HTML file in the browser and go to the console, the message contained in the console log in the JavaScript file should appear.

## 💡 Hint

Use `Cmd + Option + J` on a Mac or `Cmd +Shift +J` on Windows to open up the Developer's Console on Chrome. Alternatively, right-click on the page and select `Inspect`.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

* Comments are a key part of a developer's toolbox. Why do you think it is so important to include comments in your code? How do you write single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through the room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Script and Console.Log (10 mins)

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

* ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with linking an external JavaScript file to your HTML? (Poll via Fist of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `<script>` tags 

  * ✔️ `console.log()` 

* Open`01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 Inline `<script>` tags add JavaScript directly in the HTML file

  ```html
  <script>
  console.log("This is inline JavaScript");
  </script>
  ```
  
  * 🔑 Adding an src attribute to `<script>` tags, links to an external JavaScript file

  ```html
  <script src="script.js"></script>
  ```

  * 🔑 A console log is a JavaScript function. The message to the console is written between `()`. 

  ```js
  console.log("This is inline JavaScript");
  ```

* Open`01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console. Show the students that the message written in between the `()`is that same as what appears in the console.
  
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are two ways the `<script>` tag is used to add JavaScript to HTML files?

  * 🙋 The `<script>` tag can be used to create inline JavaScript by writing code in between the opening and closing tags. The`<script>`tag when given an src attribute that equals the path to an external JavaScript file, links the HTML file to the external JavaScript page.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: The Script Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Hello Variable (5 mins) 

* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. Following the `var`, the variable is given a unique name, or identifier.

  ```js
  var studentName;
  ```

  * Declaring a variable only gives it a name. To assign a value, we use the `=` assignment operator `=` followed by the value you want the variable to hold. 

  ```js
  var studentName = "Abdul";
  var studentAge = 32;
  ```

  * The `=` assignment operator is also used to re-assign a new value to a variable. To re-assign a value, we use the variable's name followed by `=` and the new value we want the variable to hold. Since the variable has already been declared, there is no need to use `var` again.

  ```js
  studentName = "Tonya";
  studentAge = 52;
  ``` 

  * To access the value held in a variable, we use the variable name. For example, the access the value `Tonya`, we use `studentName`. Likewise, to access the value `52`, we use `studentAge`.

  ```js
  studentName = "Tonya";
  studentAge = 52;
  ```

  * Using the variable name is also useful in our code when we want to access the value held in the variable to do something with it, like log it to the console.   

  * In the previous activity, we put a value directly into the `()` in a console log function to log a message. When the value was entered directly, that value appeared as the the message in the console. 

  ```js
  console.log("My name is ");
  ```

  * When we want to access a value stored in a variable, we don't directly enter the value. We use the variable name -- without quotes -- instead. Since the value of `studentName` is currently `Tonya`, the console log below will log `Tonya`.

  ```js
  console.log(studentName);
  ```
 
  * Sometimes, we want to use a variable as part of a longer message logged to the console. To do that, we use the concatenation operator (`+`). In the example below, `"My name is "` is concatenated, or combined, with the value stored in the variable `studentName` to form the longer message `"My name is Tonya"`.

  ```js
  console.log("My name is " + studentName);
  ```
  
* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Since the value `"My name is "` is written directly between the `()`, the message `My name is ` is logged.

  * When the variable `studentName` is logged, the variable's value is logged. Since the value of `studentName` is `Tonya`, the value `Tonya` is logged here. 

  * Combining the value `"My name is "` and the value stored in the `studentName` variable with a `+` logs "My name is Tonya". Using the concatenation operator like this will be useful in creating your introductions. 
  
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What keyword is used to declare a variable? 

  * 🙋 The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. 

  * ☝️ What operator is used to assign a value to a declared variable?  

  * 🙋 The `=` assignment operator is used to assign and re-assign a value to variable that has already been declared. 

  * ☝️ How do you access the value assigned to a variable?  

  * 🙋 Use the variable's name.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Hello Variable (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md

# Hello Variable 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to write introductions in the console using console.log() and variables.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [script.js](04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Unsolved/script.js) to implement the following features:

  * As a class member, I want to input name, number of pets, and a fun fact about myself and log an introduction to the console. Then, by only re-assigning the variables, I want to introduce my partner.

  * When I store a name in a variable called `name`, then it should log this introduction line to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

  * When I store a number in a variable called `pets`, then it should log this introduction line to the console:  "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS` pet(s)."

  * When I store a fun fact in variable called `funFact`, then it should log this introduction line to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT`"

  * When I re-assign the values of `name`, `pets` and `funFact` with my new partner's information the introduction messages above should reflect the new values.

* Open [index.html](04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Unsolved/index.html) to implement the following features:

  * When I open the HTML file in the browser and go to the console, the logs should appear. 

## 💡 Hint

The `+` operator is used to combine values in a single console log message.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you concatenate two or more variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: Hello Variable (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with JavaScript variables? (Poll via Fist of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Variable declaration

  * ✔️ Value assignment

  * ✔️ Accessing stored values

  * ✔️ Value re-assignment

* Open `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 Variables are declared using `var` and assigned a value using `=`. The variable `name` is declared using `var` and assigned the value `"Sakura"`.

  ```js
  var name = "Sakura";
  ```

  * 🔑 The variable's values are accessed using the variable name. Since the variables have assigned the values `"Sakura"`, `3` , `"I like pineapple on my pizza."`, that is the values that are used in the console logs below. 

  ```js
  console.log("My name is " + name + ".");
  console.log("I have " + pets + " pet(s).");
  console.log("Fun fact: " + funFact);
  ```

  * 🔑 Re-assign a variables' values using  `=`. The `var` keyword is not used during re-assignmment because the variable has already been declared.

  ```js
  name = "Mateo";
  pets = 5;
  funFact = "I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."
  ```

  * After the variables are re-assigned, using the variable names will access the new values `"Mateo"`, `5`, `"I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."`. The console logs will use the new values. 

  ```js
  console.log("My name is " + name + ".");
  console.log("I have " + pets + " pet(s).");
  console.log("Fun fact: " + funFact);
  ```

* Open`01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console. 

    * Note that the logs created by using `+` appear as a single message in the console. 

    * In the first introduction, the console logs use the values stored in variables as originally assigned (`"Sakura"`, `3` , `"I like pineapple on my pizza."`). 

    * Then, point out that the second introduction, the console logs uses the re-assigned values (`"Mateo"`, `5`, `"I was a yo-yo champ in third grade."`). 
    
    * Point out that the only thing different in the two introduction are the values accessed by variables. That is because the code for the console logs has not changed. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How do you re-assign a new value to a variable?  

    * 🙋 You can re-assign a variable's value by using tha assignment operator `=`. You do not need to use `var` since the variable is already declared.

    * ☝️ How do you think the ability to re-assign values to a variable may be useful in your code? 

    * 🙋 The ability to re-assign values to variables makes your code more flexible and reusable. In the activity we just completed, we were able to log new messages to the console simply by re-assigning the values stored in the variables.  

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Storing the Information You Need -- Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Primitive Values (5 mins) 

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/script.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  * In the previous activity, we learned to store values in variables. In this activity, we will take a deeper dive into types of values that are stored in variables, namely the primitive types undefined, string, numbers and booleans. 

  * A variable that has been declared using `var` but has not yet been assigned a value has the type of undefined. Undefined simply means no value have been assigned yet.

  ```js
  var myUndefined;
  ```

  * Strings should already look familar since we have already been using them in our code. Values with the type of string are a series of characters. They are commonly words, but can also include other characters like in the password example below. Strings are always surrouded by quotes. 

  ```js
  var myStringWelcome = "Hello World"; 
  var myStringPassword = "865Password!2020";
  ```

  * Numbers should look familiar too! In Javascript, a number can be either an integer (whole number) or a decimal. 

  ```js
  var myNumberInt = 100;
  var myNumberDecimal = 100.100;
  ```

  * Booleans are unique because they hold only two values: true or false.

  ```js
  var isMyBooleanTrue = true;
  var isMyBooleanFalse = false;
  ```

  * Sometimes, we want to check what type of value is stored in a variable. To evaluate type, use the `typeof` operator followed by the variable name or value. 

  ```js
  // Logs undefined
  console.log(typeof myUndefined);

  // Logs number
  console.log(typeof myNumber); 

  // Logs boolean
  console.log(typeof true);

  // Logs string
  console.log(typeof "Howdy");
  ```

* When a variable is re-assigned, its type can change too. For example, `myVariable` originally has the value of `33` and type of `number`. Then, when it is re-assigned, it has the value of `false` adn the type of `boolean`. 

```js
// Logs number
var myVariable = 33;
console.log(typeof myVariable);

// myVariable is reassigned; Logs false
myVariable = false;
console.log(typeof myVariable); 
```

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console. Point out the following:

  * The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type, including `undefined`, `number`, `boolean`, and `string`.

  * When a variable is re-assigned, the type can change as well. In our code, `myVariable` was first assigned with a number with a value of `33`. As a result, we can see it logged `number`. Then, when `myVariable` was re-assigned as a boolean with a value of `false`, `boolean` is logged, indicating the type has changed. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What primitive type has only two values? 

  * 🙋 A boolean has only two values: true or false. 

  * ☝️ What is the only primitive type that must be surrounded by quotes?

  * 🙋 Strings

  * ☝️ What primitive type would we use if we wanted to store a decimal or an integer?

  * 🙋 Numbers

  * ☝️ If we reassign a variable a new value, does the type have to stay the same?

  * 🙋 No! JavaScript is loosely typed. This means that when you declare a variable you don't have to specify a type that the variable will hold. It also means that when a variable is re-assigned the type can change too.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Primitive Types (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  @TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS TABBED
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Primitive Values (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Primitive Types? (Poll via Fist of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Strings

  * ✔️ Numbers

  * ✔️ Booleans

  * ✔️ Undefined

  * ✔️ Typeof operator

  * ✔️ Type re-assignment

* Open `06-Stu_Primitive-Types/README.md` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * The variable `one` has the whole number value of `64` and the type of `number.`

  ```js
  var one = 64;
  ```

  * Using `typeof` operator, `number` is logged.

  ```js
  // Logs number
  console.log(typeof one);
  ```

  * The variable `two` has the value of `"656302"`. Since the value is surrounded by quotes, it is a string even if the characters inside the strings are numbers!

  ```
  var two = "656302";
  ```

  * Using the `typeof` operator, `string` is logged.

  ```js
  // Logs string
  console.log(typeof two);
  ```

  * The variable `three` has a value of `false`. True and false values are booleans.

  ```js
  var three = false;
  ```

  * Using the `typeof` operator, `boolean` is logged.

  ```js
  // Logs boolean
  console.log(typeof three);
  ```

  * The variable `four` has a decimal value of 64.55. Since both integers and decimals are considered numbers in JavaScript, the type is `number`.

  ```js
  var four = 64.55;
  ```

  * Using the `typeof` operator, `number` is logged.

  ```js
  // Logs number
  console.log(typeof four);
  ```

  * The variable `five` has a value of `"Howdy"`. It is a string.

  ```js
  var five = "Howdy!";
  ```

  * Using the `typeof` operator, `string` is logged.

  ```js
  // Logs string
  console.log(typeof five);
  ```

  * The variable `six` is declared but has not yet been assigned a value. So the type returns `undefined`.

  ```js
  var six;
  ```

  * Using the `typeof` operator, `string` is logged.

  ```js
  // Logs undefined
  console.log(typeof six);
  ```

  * Reassigning the value can change both value and type.

  ```js
  four = "Hello!";
  five = false;
  six = 23;
  ```

  * Since variable `four` now has a type of `string`, then using `typeof`, `string` is logged.

  ```js
  // Logs string
  console.log(typeof four);
  ```

  * Since variable `five` now has a type of `boolean`, then using `typeof`, `boolean` is logged.

  ```js
  // Logs boolean
  console.log(typeof five);
  ```

  * Since variable `six` now has been assigned a value using the `=` assignment operator, it is no longer `undefined`. Instead, the type is `number`.

  ```js
  // Logs number
  console.log(typeof four);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are four primitive types of values? 

  * 🙋 Undefined, strings, booleans and numbers

  * ☝️ How can you test the type of a value? 

  * 🙋 Use `typeof` operator

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: JavaScript Data Types and Data Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures), and stick around for Office Hours t
