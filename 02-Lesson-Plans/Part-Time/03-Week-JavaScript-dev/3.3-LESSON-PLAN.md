# 03.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Objects 

## Overview 

In today's class, students will learn about objects, object methods, and the keyword `this`. The git concept {TODO} will also be introduced. The class also includes a group mini project aimed at reinforcing and building on foundational JavaScript skills. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `21-Ins_Objects` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be sure to review the activities and try and anticipate questions the students may ask. 

* The last hour of the class will be devoted to the Rock, Paper, Scisssors mini project. In addition to the fundamentals covered in class, the students will be asked to research window methods `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` on their own as well as find a way to randomize the computer's selection. This may prove challenging to some learners. If the students feel overwhelmed, encourage them to use pseudocoding as a problem solving tool. They can also refer to the documentation provided in `28-Stu_Mini-Project\README.md` for guidance.  

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 
 
* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Define and use JavaScript Objects

* Use JavaScript object methods

* Use and understand the `this` keyword

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Remind the students that at the beginning of the week, we previewed an interactive Rock, Paper, Scissors game to show the power of JavaScript. 

* Open `28_Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/script.js` in your IDE.

* Inform the students that this is the same code. 

* Tell the students that when come across code we want to understand better, it is often helpful to start by looking for the concepts we recognize and writing a comment to explain what it does.   

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What JavaScript concepts now look more familiar in the code?  

  * 🙋 The code uses variables, arrays, logical and conditional operators and conditional statements.

* Pause to allow the students to respond then point out the following: 

* The code uses variables to store data.

```js
var wins = 0;
var ties = 0;
var losses = 0
```

* The code uses arrays to store the computer's choices.

```js
var options = ["R", "P", "S"];
```

* The code uses conditional statments to provide the decision-making logic.

```js
if (userChoice === computerChoice) {
  ties++;
  window.alert("It's a tie!");
  } else if (
    (userChoice === "R" && computerChoice === "S") || 
    (userChoice === "P" && computerChoice === "R") || 
    (userChoice === "S" && computerChoice === "P")
  ) {
    wins++;
    window.alert("You win!");
  } else {
    losses++;
    window.alert("You lost!");
  }

```

* Tell the students that commenting is a great way to see the big picture. 

* Assure the students that it is okay if some of the code still looks unfamiliar. At the end of the class, they will have the chance to dig deeper into the code and build their own Rock, Paper, Scissors game.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Objects (5 min) 

* Open `21-Ins_Objects/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 JavaScript objects are a lot like objects in real life. They are 'things' that have distinct characteristics or properties. For our first JavaScript object, the 'thing' we are going to create is a planet. 

  * 🔑 To create our `planet` object, we use object literal notation and use curly brackets `{}`to hold the values.

  ```js
  var planet = {};
  ```

  * 🔑 We use key-value pairs to give the properties a name and a value.   

  ```js
  name: "Earth"
  ```
  
  * 🔑 Objects usually have many related properties that help to define the object. 

  ```js
  var planet = {
    name: "Earth",
    age: "4.543 billion years",
    moons: 1,
    isPopulated: true,
    population: "7.594 billion"
  };
  ```

 * 🔑 To access the value stored in a property, we use dot notation. 

 ```js
 console.log(planet.name);
 ```

* 🔑 We can also use bracket notation to access a value. Don't forget when we use bracket notation, the key goes in quotes! 

```js
console.log(planet["name"]);
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When would we want to use an object in JavaScript? 

  * 🙋 We use an object when we want to create an unordered collection of properties that describe a 'thing.'     

  * ☝️ How do we access a value stored in an object? 

  * 🙋We use dot notation and bracket notation. Both use the object's name and the associated key.

  * ☝️ Where have we used bracket notation before? 

  * 🙋 We used bracket notation with arrays. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Student Do: Objects (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Objects/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
  🏗️ Log Customer's Drink Order Using an Object

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

 * As a coffee shop owner, I want to be able to store data about my customer's drink order in an object and log a message indicating if the drink is ready or still in the queue. 

## Assessment Criteria  

  * It is done when the `customerOrder` object has three properties that store the drink's name, number of sugars and a boolean indicating if the order is ready. 

  * It is done when the drink name and number of sugars is logged to the console. 

  * It is done when "Ready for pick-up" logs if the order is ready. 

  * It is done when "Still in order queue" logs if order is not ready.  

## 💡 Hint

How can we use dot notation or bracket notation to access an object's values?  

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is a for/in statement? How can you use it to iterate over an object’s properties?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Objects (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with objects? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Object literal 

  * ✔️ Key-value pairs 

  * ✔️ Dot notation

  * ✔️ Bracket notation

* Open `22-Objects/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We declare a `customerDrink` object using object literal notation and give it three properties. 

  ```js
  var customerDrink = {
    name: "coffee",
    sugars: 3,
    isReady: true
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 We use key-value pairs to define each property.

  ```js
  name: "coffee"
  ```

  * To access the whole object, we use the object's name.

  ```js
  console.log(customerDrink);
  ```
 
  * 🔑 We use dot notation to access a value stored in a key-value pair.

  ```js
  if (customerDrink.isReady) {
    console.log("Ready for pick-up: " + customerDrink.name + " with " + customerDrink.sugars + " sugars.");
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We can also use bracket notation to access a value. 

  ```js
  else {
    console.log("Still in order queue: " + customerDrink["name"] + " with " + customerDrink["sugars"] + " sugars.");
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are key-value pairs used in objects? 

  * 🙋 The key is a unique identifier used to access the value. In objects, key-value pairs are used to define the properties of an object.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Object Methods (5 min) 

* Open `23-Ins_Object-Methods/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 An object's properties can also hold lists of values or even functions.  

  ```js
  var planet = {
    name: "Earth",
    age: "4.543 billion years",
    moons: 1,
    isPopulated: true,
    population: "7.594 billion",
    neighboringPlanets: ["Mars", "Venus"],
    tellFunFact: function () {
      console.log("The earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a Roman god or goddess.");
    },
    showWarning: function () {
      console.log("Space junk falls into Earth's atmosphere at a rate of about one a day.");
    }
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 We use arrays to store lists of values in key-value pairs.  

  ```js
  neighboringPlanets: ["Mars", "Venus"]
  ```

  * 🔑 To access an element in an array contained in an object, we can use the object's name and key plus the index of the element. 

  ```js
  console.log(planet.neighboringPlanets[0]);
  console.log(planet["neighboringPlanets"][0]);
  ```

  * 🔑To declare a method, we assign a key. A method is simply a function associated with an object. 

  ```js
  tellFunFact: function () {
    console.log("The earth is the only planet in our solar system not named after a Roman god or goddess.");
  },
  showWarning: function () {
    console.log("Space junk falls into Earth's atmosphere at a rate of about one a day.");
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 To call or invoke an object's method, we use the object's name followed by the assigned key. Don't forget the `()`! 

  ```js
  planet.tellFunFact();
  planet.showWarning();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is a method? 

  * 🙋 A method is a function associated with an object. It is also a property of the object.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Student Do: Object Methods (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Objects-Methods/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
 # 🐞Messages Not Logging to Console 

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should see a message log to the console indicating if the shelter dog or cat is available.

## Expected Behavior

When a name is stored in the `chosenPet` variable, a message should log to the console indicating if the pet is available and if it is a dog or a cat. If the pet is not available, a message should indicate that and suggest the shelter's featured cat and dog. No errors should be returned. 

## Actual Behavior

No message is logged to the console and an error message indicating an `Uncaught ReferenceError` is returned. 

## 💡 Hints

Take a look at each console log. What is the intended input? How can you use the object name and key to access the values and methods you need to make the code work? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

How can you convert an object into an array using Object.values()? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: Object Methods (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Object Methods? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `shelter.dogMessage();`

  * ✔️ `shelter.dogs`

  * ✔️ `shelter.dogs[0]`

* Open `24-Stu_Object-Methods/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * The chosenPet variable holds the name of the chosen pet. 

  ```js
  var chosenPet = "Lulu";

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use keys to access an object's properties? 

  * 🙋 We first use the object's name. Then, we use the key to identify the data we want to access. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on working with objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: This (5 min) 

* Open `25-Ins_Object-This/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 When we log the keyword `this`, the window object is logged.

  * 🔑 The window object represents the browser's open window and has many properties, including methods.  

* Open `25-Ins_Object-This/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following: 

* The `this` keyword refers an object. The global object is the open browser window.  

```js
console.log(this);
```

* When we use `this` inside of an object like `planet`, the keyword `this` belongs to that object and is used to refer to the object's properties. 

```js
logFacts: function () {
  console.log("This planet's name is " + this.name);
  console.log("This planet's age is " + this.age);
}
 ```

* When we call an object's method, `this` refers to the object the method belongs to. Since `logPopulation` belongs to the `planet` object, `this` refers to `planet`. 

```js
logPopulation: function () {
  if (this.isPopulated) {  
	  console.log("This planet's population is " + this.population);
	} else {
	  console.log("The planet is unpopulated");
	}   
}
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does the keyword `this` refer to?

  * 🙋 The keyword `this` refers to the object it belongs to. If `this` is not inside another object, it refers to the global object, or window.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Student Do: This (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26_Stu_Object-This/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of This

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [20-Stu_Object-This/Unsolved/script.js](./Unsolved/script.js).

## Note

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN web docs on this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What does the window object represent? Is the global object always the window object? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. Instructor Review: This (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the keyword `this`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `this` in global context

  * ✔️ `this` in local context

  * ✔️ `this` in object method

* Open `26-Stu_Object_This/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 When we log the keyword `this` alone, the global object, or window, is logged. 

  ```js
  console.log(this);
  ```

  * When we use `this` inside of a function, `this` refers to the global object.

  ```js
  function helloThis() { 
    console.log("Inside this function, this is " + this); 
  }
  ``` 

  * 🔑 When we use `this` inside of an object, `this` is local and belongs to that object. 

  ```js
  var child = { 
    age: 10,
    ageTenYears: function() {
      console.log(this.age + 10); 
    }
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 When we use `this` in a nested object, `this` refers to the object where it is used even if it is inside another object.  

  ```js
  var investor = {  
    name: "Cash Saver",
    investment: {
    initialInvestment: 5000,
    investmentGrowth: function() {
      console.log(this.initialInvestment * 1.15)
      }
    }   
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 When we call an object's method, `this` still refers to the object the method belongs to even when it is called outside the object. 

  ```js
  child.ageTenYears();
  investor.investment.investmentGrowth();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the global object? 

  * 🙋 The global object is the object that exists in the global scope. The window is the global object.

  * ☝️ What does the keyword `this` refer to inside an object? 

  * 🙋 The keyword `this` refers to the object. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

### 11. Everyone Do: Git (20 min) {TODO WHEN AVAILABLE}

* @TODO Open [Git docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/{TITLE}) in your browser and explain the following:

  * @TODO GIVE A SHORT EXPLANATION OF THIS GIT CONCEPT/COMMAND.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

  ```
  @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
  ```

  * 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

### 12. BREAK (40 min)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini Project (5 min) 

* Open `26-Stu_Mini-Project/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We are going to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that allows a user to play against the computer.  

  * 🔑 When we open the browser, we are prompted to enter our choice: "R, P, or S."

  * 🔑After our choice is entered and we click `OK`, we are alerted to the computer's choice. 

  * 🔑After we click `OK`, we are alerted to if we won, tied, or lost. 

  * 🔑After clicking `OK` again, we are alerted to our stats.

  * 🔑Clicking `OK` one more time brings up the prompt "Play Again?". If we selected `OK` the game starts again. If not, the game is exited. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋We are going to start with a plan! Pseudocoding will help us figure out what our code will need to look like. Then, using the JavaScript skills learned in class and a bit of research, we will write the actual code. 

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini Project (60 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Unit 03 Mini Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this activity, you will work with a group to build a game using only JavaScript.

## Instructions

* The completed application should meet the following criteria:

  * As a user, I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.

  * As a user, I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

  * As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.

  * As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

  * As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.

### Specifications

  * Must use the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` methods to collect user input and display information to the user.

  * The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.

## 💡 Hint

* Refer to the following documentation for help:

  * [MDN web docs on window.alert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert)

  * [MDN web docs on window.confirm()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm)

  * [MDN web docs on window.prompt()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt)

  * [MDN web docs on Math](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math)

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your group can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How can you customize the appearance of the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` dialog boxes?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini Project  (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ window.prompt()

  * ✔️ Randomize using Math.floor() and Math.random()

  * ✔️ window.alert()

  * ✔️ Conditional statements

  * ✔️ window.confirm()

* Open `26-Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We declare variables that will be used to count our wins, losses and ties. 

    ```js
    var wins = 0;
    var ties = 0;
    var losses = 0;
    ```
  * We also create an array to hold all the possible choices the computer can make.

  ```js
  var options = ["R", "P", "S"];
  ```

  * 🔑 To play the game, the user has to enter a choice. We use a window prompt to grab the choice and store it in a variable. 

  ```js
  var userChoice = window.prompt("Enter R, P, or S:");
  ```

  * To compare with the computer's pick, the `userChoice` must be capital letters. So, we use a string method to make sure all choices are uppercase. 

  ```js
  userChoice = userChoice.toUpperCase();
  ```

  * 🔑 We use Math.floor() combined with Math.Random() to select a random index from our `options` array. 

 ```js
  var index = Math.floor(Math.random() * options.length);
  ```

  * 🔑 The `index` is then used to assign the computer a choice. 

  ```js
  var computerChoice = options[index];
  ```

  * 🔑 We use window.alert() to alert the computer's pick in the browser. 

  ```js
  window.alert("The computer chose " + computerChoice);
  ```

  * 🔑 We use conditional statements to determine if the game is a tie, win, or loss. 

  * If the `userChoice` and `computerChoice` are equal, then it is a tie. We increment `tie` and alert that `"It's a tie!"`

  ```js
  if (userChoice === computerChoice) {
    ties++;
    window.alert("It's a tie!");
  }
  ```

  * If it is not a tie, we check if the user has won.  

  ```js
  else if (
    (userChoice === "R" && computerChoice === "S") || 
    (userChoice === "P" && computerChoice === "R") || 
    (userChoice === "S" && computerChoice === "P")
  ) {
    wins++;
    window.alert("You win!");
  }
  ```

  * If it not a tie or a win, then we alert that it is a loss and increment `losses`. 

  ```js
  else {
    losses++;
    window.alert("You lost!");
  }
  ```

  * We use an alert to show the user the stats. The `\n` creates line breaks. 

  ```js
  window.alert(
    "Stats:\nWins: " + wins + "\nLosses: " + losses + "\nTies: " + ties
  );
  ```

* We use window.confirm() to determine if the user wants to play again. 

```js
var playAgain = window.confirm("Play again?");
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are users able to interact with the Rock, Paper, Scissors, Game?  

  * 🙋 The users interact through a series of pop-up boxes that prompt them to provide a choice, share a message or ask them to confirm if they want to play again. The window methods used to create these pop-up boxes are `windows.alert()`, `windows.confirm()`, and `windows.prompt`. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on window prompt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt), [MDN web docs on window confirm](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm), [MDN web docs on window alert](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert) and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
