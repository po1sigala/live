# 03.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Objects 

## Overview 

In today's class, students will learn about objects, object methods, and the keyword `this`. The git concept {TODO} will also be introduced. The class also includes a group mini-project aimed at reinforcing and building on the students' JavaScript skills. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `21-Ins_Objects` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be sure to review the activities and try and anticipate questions the students may ask. 

* The last hour of the class will be devoted to the Rock, Paper, Scisssors  mini-project. In addition to the fundamentals covered in class, the students will be asked to research `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` methods own their own as well as find a way to randomize the computer's selection. This may prove challenging to some learners. If the students feel overwhelmed, encourage them to use pseudocoding as a problem solving tool. They can also refer to the documentation provided in the README for guidance.  

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Define a JavaScript Object

* Implement object methods

* Identify the `this` keyword 

* Integrate JavaScript fundamentals to create a simple game

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What JavaScript concepts have we learned so far? 

  * 🙋 We learned about adding JavaScript to HTML files, console logs, variables, primitive types, logical operators, comparison operators, and conditional statements on the first day. Next, we learned arrays, iteration, array methods, functions and scope.

* As the students answer, make a list to visually reinforce how much they have learned. 

* Inform the students that the concepts in the list are the same as those used by both beginning and seasoned JavaScript developers to make games, build apps and add interactivity to web pages. 

* Remind the students that at the beginning of the week, we previewed a JavaScript game. 

* Open `28_Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/script.js` in your IDE.

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What JavaScript concepts from the list we just created are used in the code? 

  * 🙋 The code uses logical and comparison operators, variables and arrays. 

* Point out the concepts named by the students in the code. 

* Assure the students that it is okay if they still don't understand all the code. At the end of the class, they will have a chance to explore the code more and work in a group to create their own Rock, Paper, Scissors game.   

* Transition to the first activity by telling students that before tackling the mini-project, we are first going to learn another fundamental concept in JavaScript: objects. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Objects (5 min) 

* Open `21-Ins_Objects/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In JavaScript, objects are much like objects in real life. They are 'things' that have properties that define their characteristics. In our first object, the 'thing' we are going to create is a planet and it will have a name, age and other properties that give our planet distinct characteristics.  

  * 🔑 To create our object, we use an object literal. We start with `var` and the assignment operator `=` and use curly brackets `{}`to hold the values.

  ```js
  var planet = {...};
  ```
  * 🔑We use key-value pairs to store values. The key acts like an identifier and is used to access the value.  

  ```js
  name: "Earth"
  ```
  * 🔑 The association between the key and value is known as a property. Objects usually have many related properties that provide the characteristics for  the object.   

  ```js
  var planet = {
  name: "Earth",
  age: "4.543 billion years",
  moons: 1,
  isPopulated: true,
  population: "7.594 billion"
  };
  ```

* 🔑 To access the value stored in a key-value pair, we use dot notation. The object's name comes first and then the name of the key. 

```js
console.log(planet.name);
```

* 🔑 We can also use bracket notation. 

```js
console.log(planet["name"]);
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When would we want to use an object in JavaScript? 

  * 🙋 We use an object when we want to create an unordered collection of properties that describe a 'thing.'     

  * ☝️ How do we access a value stored in an object? 

  * 🙋We use the object's name followed by the key. In bracket notation, the key goes in quotes inside brackets. In dot notation, object name and key are separated by a dot. 

  * ☝️ Where have we used bracket notation before? 

  * 🙋 We used bracket notation with arrays. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Student Do: Objects (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Objects/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  🏗️ Log Customer's Drink Order Using an Object

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

 * As a coffee shop owner, I want to be able to store data about my customer's drink order in an object and log a message indicating if the drink is ready or still in the queue. 

## Assessment Criteria  

  * It is done when the `customerOrder` object has three properties that store the drink's name, number of sugars and a boolean indicating if the order is ready. 

  * It is done when the drink name and number of sugars is logged to the console. 

  * It is done when "Ready for pick-up" logs if the order is ready. 

  * It is done when "Still in order queue" logs if order is not ready.  

## 💡 Hint

How can we use dot notation or bracket notation to access an object's values?  

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is a for/in statement? How can you use it to iterate over an object’s properties?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Objects (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with objects? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

  * ✔️ Object literal 

  * ✔️ Key-value pairs 

  * ✔️ Accessing value with bracket notation

  * As a user, I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.

  * As a user, I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

  * As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.

  * As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

  * As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.

### Specifications
