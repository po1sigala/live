### 8. Instructor Demo: Primitive Values (5 mins) 

* Open `05-Ins_Primitive-Types/script.js` in your IDE and point out the following:

  *  In the previous activity, we learned to store values in variables. In this activity, we will take a deeper dive into  types of values that are stored in variables, namely the primitive types undefined, string, numbers and booleans 

  * A variable that has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value has the type of undefined.

  ```
      var myUndefined;

  ```

  *  Strings should already look familar!  Values with the type string are a series of characters and is surrounded by quotes 

  ```

  ```

  * 🔑  In Javascript, a number can be either an integer (whole number) or a decimal. 

  ```

  ```

  * 🔑  Booleans are unique because they hold only two values: true or false

  ```

  ```

  * 🔑 Sometimes, developers want to check what type of value is stored in a variable. To evaluate type, you can use `typeof`

  ```

  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ What primitive type has only two values? 

    * 🙋 A boolean has only two values: true or false. 

    * ☝️ What is the only primitive type that must be surrounded by quotes?

    * 🙋 Strings

    * ☝️ What primitive type would we use if we wanted to store a decimal or an integer?

    * 🙋 Numbers

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

### 9. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  @TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS TABBED
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Primitive Values (10 mins) 


* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with `@TODO TOPIC`? (Poll via Fist of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Strings

  * ✔️ Numbers

  * ✔️ Booleans

  * ✔️ Undefined

   * ✔️ Type of



* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

    ```
    @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
    ```

  * 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

     * ☝️ What are four primitive types of values? 

    * 🙋 Undefined, strings, booleans and numbers

    * ☝️ How can you test the type of a value? 

    * 🙋 Use `typeof`

    * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

    * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: JavaScript Data Types and Data Structure](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures), and stick around for Office Hours t

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
