# 03.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Arrays and Functions

## Overview 

This class is a continuation of JavaScript fundamentals. Arrays, iteration, and array methods are introduced. In addition, function expressions, function declarations, and scope are also explored.     

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_Arrays` through `20-Stu_Methods`.

* Take a few minutes before class to review the activities of the day and think about questions students with a limited exposure to JavaScript may ask. 

* In `19-Stu_Scope`, students are asked to work with a partner to debug some broken code to learn more about scope and shadowing. This is a challenging activity especially for learners new to programming languages. Please make sure to look through the solution code prior to class and think about the questions that may arise. If need be, review [MDN Web Docs; Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) so you can confidently answer students questions. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to: 

* Create an array and access data elements using index

* Iterate over an array using a for-loop

* Write a function expression and a function declaration

* Identify the difference between global and local scope

* Array methods

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Show the students the number `4,294,967,295`.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What do you think the number `4,294,967,295` represents in JavaScript? 

  * üôã `4,294,967,295` is the maximum number of values that can be stored in a single variable in JavaScript. 

* Explain that so far, we have been using variables to store a single value like `"Hello, World"`, `5` or `true`. 



### 2. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 mins) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * üîë @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.
