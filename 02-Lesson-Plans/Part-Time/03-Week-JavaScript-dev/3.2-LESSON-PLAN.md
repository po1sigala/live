# 03.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Arrays and Functions

## Overview 

This class is a continuation of JavaScript fundamentals. Arrays, iteration, and array methods are a focus of the activities. In addition, function expressions, function declarations, and scope are also introduced.     

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_Arrays` through `20-Stu_Methods`.

* Take a few minutes before class to review the activities of the day and think about questions students with a limited exposure to JavaScript may ask. 

* In `19-Stu_Scope`, students are asked to work with a partner to debug some broken code to learn more about scope and shadowing. This is a challenging activity especially for learners new to programming languages. Please make sure to look through the solution code prior to class and try to anticipate questions that may arise. If need be, review [MDN Web Docs; Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) so you can confidently answer students' questions. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to: 

* Create an array and access elements using index

* Iterate over an array using a for loop

* Write a function expression and a function declaration

* Identify the difference between global and local scope

* Implement array methods

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Show the class the number `4,294,967,295`. 

* Do not provide students further context at this point. The goal is to pique the learners’ curiosity. 

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think the number `4,294,967,295` represents in JavaScript? 

  * 🙋 `4,294,967,295` is the maximum number of values that can be stored in a single variable in JavaScript. 

* Explain that so far, we have been using variables to store a single value like `"Hello, World"`, `5` or `true` and writing blocks of code that execute one time. However, that is not very efficient! JavaScript is capable of much more, even working with billions of values. 

* Stress that during today's class, we are going to think bigger! Building on our JavaScript skills, we will learn how to store multiple values in a single array, perform an action on all the values stored in variable with just a few lines of code, and even write reusable code blocks to use again and again in our code. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Arrays (5 mins) 

* Open `11-Ins_Array/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Previously, we learned to use `var` and the assignment operator `=` to store a single value in a variable. 

  ```js
  var name = "Andre";
  var pets = 3; 
  var isStudent = true;
  ```

  * 🔑 To store multiple values in a variable, we also use `var` and `=`. To hold multiple values, we put them in brackets `[]` separated by commas. 

  ```js
  var names = ["Andre", "Karl", "Rashida", "Olivia"];
  ```

  * 🔑 To access the entire array, we use the array's name.

  ```js
  console.log(names);
  ```

  * 🔑 To access a single element in an array, we use the array's name plus the item's index or place in the array in brackets`[]`. The element with the index of `1` is `"Karl"`. 

  ```js
  console.log(names[1]);
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays are zero-indexed! So the first element in an array has an index of `0`, not `1`. Using `0` will log `Andre` and as we saw above, using `1` will actually log the second item in the array, `Karl`! 

  ```js
  console.log(names[0]); 
  ```

  * 🔑 We can also use an element's index to replace a value in the array.

  * 🔑 In the `names` array, the string `"Olivia"` has an index of `3`. 

  ```js
  console.log(names[3]);
  ```

  * 🔑 We re-assign `names[3]` to a new string `"Carter"` using the assignment operator `=`. After re-assignment, the new value `"Carter"` is logged. 

  ```js
  names[3] = "Carter"; 

  console.log(names[3])
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays also have properties. We find the total number of elements in the array using the `length` property. Since, the `names` array has four elements, this will return `4`. 

  ```js
  console.log(names.length)
  ```

* Open `11-Ins_Array/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When we log an array to the console using its name, the entire array is returned.

  * When we click on the arrow to the left of the data, the indices of each element in the array are shown. This is a handy way to inspect an array and find the index of an element we want to work with in our code. 

  * When we log an array's length, a `number` is returned. That number equals the total number of elements in the array.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we store multiple values in a variable?

  * 🙋 We use an array. 

  * ☝️ How do we access an element in the array? 

  * 🙋 We use the the array name and the index. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Student Do: Arrays (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Arrays/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗 Log Welcome Messages to Console Using an Array

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an instructor, I want to create a list of my students' names and use that list
 to welcome each of my students to class. I also want to remove a student who has left the 
 class and replace the name with a new student's name. 

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It is done when the total number of elements in the array is logged to the console.  

* It is done when "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME" is logged using each element in the array. 

* It is done when the first element in the array is removed and that element is 
replaced with the name of a new student.

* It is done when "REPLACED_NAME is in class" is logged when an `if statement` is used 
to test if the first element in the array has been replaced. 
 
## 💡 Hint

What is the first index in an array? Is is `0` or `1`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could you use the array's length property to access the last element in an array of any length?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Arrays (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with arrays? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `var students = ["name1"]`

  * ✔️ `students.length`

  * ✔️ `students[0]`

  * ✔️ `students[0] = "newName"

* Open `12-Stu_Arrays/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 When creating an array, the elements are placed in brackets `[]`. Each element is separated by a comma. 

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * 🔑 We use the array name `students` followed by `length` to return a count of the total number of elements in the array.

  ```js
  console.log(students.length);
  ```

  * 🔑 We access an element in the array using the element's index. The first element's index is `0`, the second element's index is `1` and so on. 

  ```js
  console.log("Welcome to the class " + students[0]);
  ```

   * 🔑 We replace an element in the array by using the element's index and the assignment operator `=` followed by the new value. The code below replaces the first element in the `student` array with the string `"Bob"`.

  ```js
  students[0] = "Bob";
  ```

  * We test if the first value has been replaced using an if statement that evaluates if `students[0]` equals `"Bob"`. If the condition evaluates to true, `"Bob is in class!"` logs to the console. 

  ```js
  if (students[0] === "Bob") {
    console.log(students[0] + " is in class!");
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does it mean that arrays are zero-indexed? 

  * 🙋 The first element of the array has an index of `0` not `1`.

  * ☝️ What property can we use if we went to determine the total number of elements in an array? 

  * 🙋The array's length property

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Iteration (5 mins) 

* Open `13-Ins_Iteration/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use for loops to execute a block of code more than once.

  * 🔑 A for statement starts with the keyword `for` followed by parentheses`()`. Inside the parentheses, there are three expressions separated by semicolons. These expressions determine on how the loop will work.  

  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
  ```
  * The first expression declares a variable. That variable is used as the counter for the loop. Since we want to start at `0`, we assign the value of `i` to be `0`. 

  ```js
  var i = 0;
  ```

  * The second expression is a condition that determines if the loop will execute. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the loop will execute. If not, it won't and the loop is stopped. 

  ```js
  i < 5;
  ```

  * The final expression increments the counter variable `i` after the block of code executes. 

  ```js
  i++
  ```

  * 🔑 Next, the block of code we want to execute each time the loop runs goes in curly brackets `{}` after the parentheses `()`.

  ```js
  {
    console.log("This is the current value of i: " + i + ".");
  }
  ```
  
  * 🔑 For loops will execute the block of code again and again until the conditional expression evaluates to `false`. This makes for loops great for iterating over an array.

  
  * 🔑 When iterating over an array, we use the array's `length` property to determine when the loop should stop. In this case, as long as `i` is less than the length of `zooAnimals`, the loop will continue on. When it no longer is, it will stop. 
  
  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < zooAnimals.length; i++) 
  ```
  * 🔑 We can also `i` to access the elements of the array. We can do this by placing `i` in brackets following the array's name. Let's see this in action in the console. 

  ```js 
  { 
    console.log("I am going to zoo to see " + zooAnimals[i] + ".");
  }
  ```
* Open `13-Ins_Iteration/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * In the first loop, our counter variable `i` is initially assigned the value `0`. So, the first log shows the value of `i` is `0`. Then, after the block of code is executed, `i` is incremented. So, when it runs again, `i` is 1 and so on until the condition `i < 5` is no longer `true`. 

  * In the next loop, instead of just console logging `i`, `i` is used to determine the index of the element. So the first time it is run, `zooAnimals[i]` is read as `zooAnimals[0]` and `"Bears"` is logged. When the loop runs again, `i` is equal to 1, so `"Giraffes"` is logged. Doing this, we can use a for loop to quickly iterate over an entire array -- even a huge one -- with just a few lines of code. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would we want to use a loop in our code?  

  * 🙋 We can execute a block of code over and over again.  

  * ☝️ How do we stop a loop from executing? 

  * 🙋 A loop will stop executing when the condition is `false`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 6. Student Do: Iteration (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Iteration/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗️ Iterate Over an Array to Log Messages to Console

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a member of the class, I want to store a list of my classmates and use that list to create a greeting for each student on the list. 

## Instructions

* It is done when the names of five classmates are stored in a single variable named `students`.

* It is done when the total number of elements in the `students` array is logged to the console. 

* It is done when using a for loop the greeting "Great to see you, CLASSMATE_NAME!" logs to the console for each classmate's name in the `students` array. 

## 💡 Hint

How can you use the element's index and the array name to access each element? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What’s a while loop?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: Iteration (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with creating a for loop and iterating over an array? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ For statement 

  * ✔️ Array iteration

* Open `14-Stu_Iteration/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We start by creating a `students` array that holds five names. 

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * We then use the `length` property to find the total number of elements in the `students` array. This length property will come in handy when we set the condition for our loop. 

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * 🔑 To write our for loop, we start with `for` followed by parentheses `()`. Inside the parentheses, we will add three statements separated by a semi-colon.
  
  ```js
  for(var i=0; i < students.length; i++)
  ```
  
  *  The first statement assigns the value of `i` to `0`. 

  ```js
  var i =0;
  ```

  * 🔑 The second statement is a condition that uses the `students` array's `length` to determine when to stop. If this condition evaluates to `true`, the loop will continue executing. If not, the loop will stop. Since we want it to iterate over the entire array, we set the condition to `i < students.length`.

  ```js
  i < students.length;
  ```

 * Finally, after the block of code is executed, we want `i` to increment by `1` so we use `++`.

 ```js
 i++
 ```

* 🔑 To console log each element in the array, we use the array name and `i`. This code block will execute again and again until the condition `i < students.length` is false.

```js
console.log("Great to see you, " + students[i]);
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would iterating over an array be useful in our own code?  

  * 🙋 By iterating over an array, we can perform an action on each element of the array quickly and with just a few lines of code. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Functions (5 mins) 

* Open `15-Ins_Functions/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 We create reusable blocks of code using functions.

  * 🔑 One way we can define a function is to use a function declaration. A function declaration starts with the keyword `function` followed by a name and parentheses `()`.

  ```js
  function declareHello()
  ```
  * 🔑 The block of code we want to execute goes in curly brackets `{}`. Then after the code we want to execute, we use `return`. The return statement stops the execution of the function.   

  ```js
  function declareHello() { 
  console.log("Hello, I am a function declaration.");
  console.log("-----------------------------------");
  return;
  }
  ```
  * 🔑 We can also use `var` to declare a function expression. After the assignment operator `=`, we use `function` followed by parentheses `()`. Just like before, the code block goes in curly brackets `{}` and `return` is used.

  ```js
  var expressHello = function() { 
  console.log("Hello, I am a function expression.");
  console.log("-----------------------------------");
  return;
  };
  ```
  * 🔑 When we define a function expression or function declaration, we are simply giving a block of code a name. To execute the function, we call it using the function's name and parentheses `()`. 

  ```js
  declareHello(); 
  expressHello();
  ```

  * 🔑 Functions can also take parameters! Parameters allow us to pass values into a function by giving the values a name. In the example below, the values we want to use in the code block are given the names `x`, `y`,  and `z`. 

  ```js
  function declareHelloAgain(x,y,z) { 
  console.log("Hello, my parameter's values are " + x + ", " + y + ", and " + z);
  console.log("-----------------------------------");
  return;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Adding parameters inside the `()`, only gives them names, not values! The values are assigned when the function is called. So in this case `x` has been assigned `7`, `y` has been assigned `"Hello"` and `z` has been assigned `true`. 

  ```js
  declareHelloAgain(7, "Hello", true);
  ```

* Open `15-Ins_Functions/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following: 

  * Calling a function executes the code block one time. To execute the block of code again, simply call the function again. This makes the code block easily reusable in our code. 

  * When we call `declareHelloAgain`, the values provided for `x`, `y`, and `z`can be accessed by the function. So, "Hello, my parameter's values are 7, Hello, and true" is logged. 
  
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are two ways that we can use to create a reusable block of code? 

  * 🙋 We can create a function declaration or a function expression.

   * ☝️ How do we execute a function? 

  * 🙋 Declaring a function only gives a block of code a name. To execute it, we have to call it every time we want the action performed. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Student Do: Functions (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Functions/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗️ Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* In this activity, you will work with a partner to write a function that takes in two values and evaluates equality.

## Instructions

* It is done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality. 

* It is done if "They are equal in type and value" is logged if the values are strictly equal. 

* It is done if "They are equal in value" is logged if the two values are equal but not strictly equal.

* It is done if "The values are not equal" if the values are not equal or strictly equal. 

## 💡 Hints
 
How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate with our function? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is hoisting?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Functions (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with functions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Function declaration

  * ✔️ Parameters

  * ✔️ Return

  * ✔️ Function calls

  * ✔️ Function expressions

* Open `16-Stu_Functions/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 To create a function declaration, we start with the keyword `function` and give it a name `isEqual`. Then, inside the parentheses`()`, we provide two parameters `x` and  `y` to provide a name for the two values we want the function to evaluate. 

  ```js
  function isEqual(x,y)
  ```

  * We put our code block in curly brackets `{}` and use an if statement to evaluate if the value assigned to `x` is strictly equal the value assigned to `y`. If so, then `"They are equal in type and value"` will log. 

  ```js
  if (x === y) {
      console.log("They are equal in type and value");
    }
  ```

  * If our two values are not strictly equal, we check if they are equal in value only `==`. So, we add an else if statement that will log `"They are equal in value"` if `x == y` evaluates to `true`. 

  ```js
  } else if (x == y) {
       console.log("They are equal in value");
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an else statement to log a message if the two values are not strictly equal or equal. We also add a `return` to stop the execution of the function.

  ```js
  } else {
      console.log("They are not equal");
    }
    return;
  ```

  * 🔑 We execute the block of code by calling it with its name. Inside the parentheses, we put the two values we want to assign to `x` and `y` when the function runs.

  ```js
  isEqual(10, 10);
  ```

 * 🔑 We can also use a function expression to execute the same block of code. A function expression starts with `var`. Both functions will do the same thing.

 ```js
 var isEqualTakeTwo = function (x,y) {
    if (x === y) {
       console.log("They are equal in type and value");
    } else if (x == y) {
      console.log("They are equal in value");
    } else {
      console.log("They are not equal");
    }
    return;
 };
 ```

* Open `16-Stu_Functions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When a function is called, the values assigned inside the parentheses `()` are used to execute the code.  

  * So when we assign the values `10` and `10`, `"They are equal in type and value"` logs to the console.

  * When we assign the values `10` and `true`, `"They are not equal"` logs. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can using functions help improve our code? 

  * 🙋 Functions are reusable blocks of code that we can execute again and again. Using functions makes our code more modular and help us write cleaner code.  

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Scope (5 mins) 

* Open `17-Ins_Scope/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 So far, we have been declaring variables outside of any functions. Variables declared outside of any function are global and available in the global scope.

  ```js
  var hello = "Hello"; 
  ```
  * A variable in the global scope can be used throughout your code in any function or script. Both of these functions have access to the value stored in the variable. `hello`.

  ```js
  function sayHello() {
  console.log(hello);
  return;
  }

  var sayHelloAgain = function () {
  console.log(hello);
  return;
  };
  ```
* 🔑 Sometimes, we want to declare a variable inside a function. When we do this, this changes the scope and the variable can only be accessed inside that function. This is called local scope. If we try to use a locally-scoped variable another function, we will get an error. 

```js
function sayGoodbye() { 
  var goodbye = "Goodbye";
  console.log(goodbye);
  return;
}

var sayGoodbyeAgain = function () { 
  console.log(goodbye);
  return;
};
```
* 🔑 Shadowing happens we we use the same variable name in both the local and global scope. It can cause unexpected results! We should avoid shadowing by giving our local and global variables unique names. 
 
```js
var shadow = "Hello";
 console.log(shadow);

function sayWhat() {
  console.log(shadow);
  return;
}

var sayWhatAgain = function () {
  var shadow = "Goodbye";
  console.log(shadow);   
};
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does it mean when a variable is globally scoped? 

  * 🙋 A global variable is accesssible to any function or script in the code. 

   * ☝️ What does it mean if a variable is locally scoped?

  * 🙋 A local variable is only available inside its own function. It is not available to other functions or scripts.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

# 🐞 Messages Not Logging to Console Due to Undefined Variables

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to log messages to the console using variables declared in both global and local scope. 

## Expected Behavior

When the console is opened, a series of messages should log to the console. 

## Actual Behavior

When the console is opened, an error message indicates that at least one variable is undefined and messages do not log.

## 💡 Hint

If stuck, try to think about how the variable is being used. Is it being made available to all functions? Or is it only being used by one function?    

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is lexical scope?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: Scope (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with scope? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Global scope

  * ✔️ Local scope

  * ✔️ Shadowing

* Open `18-Stu_Scope/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We declare the variable `shout` in the global scope so is available to all functions including `justShout` and `shoutItAllOut`.

  ```js
  var shout = "Shout";

  function justShout() {
    console.log(shout + ", " + shout);
    return;
  }
 
  function shoutItAllOut() {
    console.log(shout + " it all out! ");
    return;
  }  
   ```

  * 🔑 The variable `animals` has been declared locally inside the `sayLions` function, so it only available in that function.

  ```js
  function sayLions() {
    var animal = "Lions"; 
    console.log(animal);
    return;
  }
  ```

* 🔑 We declare the variable `animals` locally inside the `sayTigers`. Since a locally scoped variable is only accessed in the function where it is declared, it doesn't change the value of the `animal` variable declared in `sayLions`. The `sayLions` function will use the value `Lions` and the `sayTigers` function  will use the value `Tigers`. 

 ```js
function sayTigers() {
  var animal = "Tigers";
  console.log("and " + animal + " and "); 
  return;
 }
 ``` 

 * 🔑 To avoid shadowing, or declaring a variable with the same name in the global and local scope, we remove the `bears` variable to the local scope so that `sayBears` function will log `"Bears! OH MY!"`

 ```js
 var bears = "Bears";

 function sayBears() {
  console.log(bears + "! OH  MY!");
  return;
 }

```
* This is a nested function! We declare the variable `sing` inside the outer function so the value of `sing` is available to everything inside the outer function, including the inner function. 

```js
function singAlong() {
  var sing = "Sing";
  console.log(sing + ",");
  var singASong = function () {  
    console.log(sing + " a Song.");
   };
  singASong();
 }
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why is it important to know if our variables are defined in the local or global scope? 

  * 🙋 Scope tells us where our variables are accessible to use in our code. If we define our variables in the wrong scope, we will get errors!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Methods (5 mins) 

* Open `19-Ins_Methods/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Arrays have access to built-in methods that allow us to manipulate arrays and the elements they hold. 

  * 🔑 Array methods are easy to use. We simply use the name of the array followed by a dot `.` and the name of the method with parentheses `()`. The `sort` method sorts the elements in an array in alphabetical and ascending order. 

  ```js
  comparisonOperators.sort();
  ```

  * 🔑 Some array methods take arguments. We put the argument value in the parentheses`()`. The `push()` method attaches the value placed in the parentheses `()`at the end of an array.

  ```js
  arithmaticOperators.push("%");
  ```

  * 🔑 Array methods can also return a new array. The `slice()` method returns a slice of an array as a new array. The arguments determine what indexes to use to start and end the slice. 

  ```js
  var logicalOperatorsSliced = logicalOperators.slice(0,2);
  ```

  * 🔑 Strings also have methods. The `replace` method will return a new string. In that new string, "String" is replaced with "World." 

  ```js
  var myNewString = myString.replace("String", "World");
  ```

   * 🔑 There are a lot of array and string methods that you can use with your code. This is just a small sample of the built-in methods available to arrays and strings. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is an array method?  

  * 🙋 An array method is a built-in method that we can use to manipulate arrays and the elements stored in them. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Student Do: Methods (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in`20-Stu_Methods/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 📖 Implement Array and String Methods

 Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

 * As an developer, I want to use array methods to add and remove elements from an array and join two arrays. I also want to use a string method to return a new string that contains only capital letters.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the string `Canis Major` is added as the first element of the `constellations` array and no elements are removed. 

* It is done when `Venus` is removed from the `planets` array.

* It is done when the arrays `constellations` and `planets` are joined to form a new array named `galaxy`. The arrays `constellations` and `planets` should not be altered.

* It is done when the string "polaris" is converted into all capital letters and the new string is stored in a variable.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN Web Docs: Array Instance Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods)

[MDN Web Docs: String Instance Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods)

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you use typeof on an array? What is returned? Is that what you expected? Why or why not? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above. 

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 17. Instructor Review: Methods (15 mins)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with array and string methods? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Array method

  * ✔️ String method

* Open `20-Stu_Methods/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 Documentation is a great way to learn about the many array methods and how to implement them in your code. 

  * We use the `unshift` array method to add an element to the beginning of the `constellation` array. The value added to the array goes inside the parentheses `()`. 

  ```js
  constellations.unshift("Canis Major");
  ```

  * We use the `pop` method to remove the last element in the planets array.

  ```js
  planets.pop();
  ```

  * To join two arrays, we use the `concat` method. This method returns a new array named `galaxy`.

  ```js
  var galaxy = constellations.concat(planets);
  ```

  * 🔑 We use the string method `toUpperCase` to return the new string "POLARIS".

  ```js
  var upperCaseStar = star.toUpperCase();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we use array and string methods to supercharge our code? 

  * 🙋 Array methods are a quick and easy way to add elements, remove elements, join two arrays and much, much more. String methods are also a powerful way to manipulate strings. With both array and string methods, we are able to implement powerful functionality in just a single line of code. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Array Instance Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods) and [MDN Web Docs: String Instance Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods) documentation, and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
