# 03.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Arrays and Functions

## Overview 

This class is a continuation of JavaScript fundamentals. Arrays, iteration, and array methods are introduced. In addition, function expressions, function declarations, and scope are also explored.     

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_Arrays` through `20-Stu_Methods`.

* Take a few minutes before class to review the activities of the day and think about questions students with a limited exposure to JavaScript may ask. 

* In `19-Stu_Scope`, students are asked to work with a partner to debug some broken code to learn more about scope and shadowing. This is a challenging activity especially for learners new to programming languages. Please make sure to look through the solution code prior to class and try to anticipate questions that may arise. If need be, review [MDN Web Docs; Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) so you can confidently answer students' questions. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to: 

* Create an array and access data elements using index

* Iterate over an array using a for loop

* Write a function expression and a function declaration

* Identify the difference between global and local scope

* Implement array methods

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Show the class the number `4,294,967,295`. 

* Do not provide students further context at this point. The goal is to pique the learners’ curiosity. 

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think the number `4,294,967,295` represents in JavaScript? 

  * 🙋 `4,294,967,295` is the maximum number of values that can be stored in a single variable in JavaScript. 

* Explain that so far, we have been using variables to store a single value like `"Hello, World"`, `5` or `true` and writing blocks of code that execute one time. However, that is not very efficient! JavaScript is capable of much more, even working with billions of values. 

* Stress that during today's class, we are going to think bigger! Building on our JavaScript skills, we will learn how to store multiple values in a single array, perform an action on all the values stored in variable with just a few lines of code, and even write reusable code blocks to use again and again in our programs. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Arrays (5 mins) 

* Open `11-Ins_Array/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Previously, we learned to use `var` and the assignment operator `=` to store a single value in a variable. 

  ```js
  var name = "Andre";
  var pets = 3; 
  var isStudent = true;
  ```

  * 🔑 To store multiple values in a variable, we also use `var` and `=`. But this time, we use brackets `[]` to hold our values and separate the values, or elements, by commas `,`.

  ```js
  var names = ["Andre", "Karl", "Rashida", "Olivia"];
  ```

  * 🔑 To access the entire array, we use the array's name.

  ```js
  console.log(names);
  ```

  * 🔑 To access a single element in an array, we use the array's name plus the item's index or place in the array in brackets`[]`. This logs `Karl`. 

  ```js
  console.log(names[1]);
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays are zero-indexed! So the first element in an array has an index of `0`, not `1`. Using `0` will log `Andre`.

  ```js
  console.log(names[0]); 
  ```

  * 🔑 We can also use an element's index to replace a value in the array.

  * 🔑 In the `names` array, the string `"Olivia"` has an index of `3`. So, this logs `Olivia`.

  ```js
  console.log(names[3]);
  ```

  * 🔑 We can also re-assign `names[3]` to a new string `"Carter"` using the assignment operator `=`. After re-assignment, `"Carter"` is logged. 

  ```js
  names[3] = "Carter"; 

  console.log(names[3])
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays also have properties. We can find the total number of elements in the array using the `length` property. Since, the `names` array has four elements, this will return `4`. 

  ```js
  console.log(names.length)
  ```

* Open `11-Ins_Array/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When we log an array to the console using its name, the entire array is returned.

  * When we click on the arrow to the left of the data, the indices of each element in the array are shown. The first element has an index of `0`. The last element has an index of `3`.

  * The length of the `student` array is `4`. Since arrays are zero-indexed, the length is not equal to the highest index. It is the equal to the highest index plus one!

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we store multiple values in a variable?

  * 🙋 We use an array. 

  * ☝️ How do we access an element in the array? 

  * 🙋 We use the the array name and the index. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Arrays/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Arrays (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Arrays/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗 Log Welcome Messages to Console Using an Array

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an instructor, I want to create a group of my students' names and use the data from that group
 to welcome each of my students to class. I also want to remove a student who has left the 
 class and replace the name with a new student's name. 

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It is done when the total number of elements in the array is logged to the console.  

* It is done when "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME" is logged using each element in the array. 

* It is done when the first element in the array is removed and that element is 
replaced with the name of a new student.

* It is done when "REPLACED_NAME is in class" is logged when an `if statement` is used 
to test if the first element in the array has been replaced. 
 
## 💡 Hint

What is the first index in an array? Is is `0` or `1`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could you use the array's length property to access the last element in an array of any length?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Arrays (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with arrays? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Create array

  * ✔️ Array length

  * ✔️ Access array element

  * ✔️ Replace array element

* Open `12-Stu_Arrays/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 When creating an array, we use brackets `[]` to hold the data and separate the data with commas `,`.

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * 🔑 We determine the length of the `student` array using the array name followed by `length`.

  ```js
  console.log(students.length);
  ```

  * 🔑 We access an element in the array using the element's index. The first element's index is `0`. 

  ```js
  console.log("Welcome to the class " + students[0]);
  ```

   * 🔑 We replace an element in the array by using the element's index and the assignment operator `=` followed by the new value. This replaces the first element in the array with the string `"Bob"`.

  ```js
  students[0] = "Bob";
  ```

  * We test if the first value has been replaced using an if statement that evaluates if `students[0]` equals `"Bob"`.

  ```js
  if (students[0] === "Bob") {
    console.log(students[0] + " is in class!");
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does it mean that arrays are zero-indexed? 

  * 🙋 The first element of the array has an index of `0` not `1`.

  * ☝️ What property can we use if we went to determine the total number of elements in an array? 

  * 🙋The array's length property

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Iteration (5 mins) 

* Open `13-Ins_Iteration/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use loops to execute a block of code more than once.

  * 🔑 A for statement starts with the keyword `for` followed by parentheses`()`. Inside the parentheses, there are three expressions separated by semicolons `;`. These expressions provide the information on how the loop will work.  

  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
  ```
  * The first expression declares a variable. That variable is used as the counter for the loop. Since we want to start at `0`, we assign the value of `i` to be `0`. 

  ```js
  var i = 0;
  ```

  * The second expression is a condition that determines if the loop will execute. If the expression evaluates to `true`, the loop will execute. If not, it won't.

  ```js
  i < 5;
  ```

  * The final expression increments the counter variable `i` after the block of code executes. 

  ```js
  i++
  ```

  * 🔑 Next, the block of code we want to execute each time the loop runs goes in curly brackets `{}` after the parentheses `()`.

  ```js
  {
    console.log("This is the current value of i: " + i + ".");
  }
  ```
  
  * 🔑 For loops will execute the block of code again and again until the conditional expression evaluates to `false`. This makes for loops great for iterating over an array.

  
  * 🔑 When iterating over an array, we use the array's `length` property to determine when the loop should stop. In this case, as long as `i` is less than the length of `zooAnimals`, the loop will continue.
  
  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < zooAnimals.length; i++) 
  ```
  * 🔑 We can also `i` to access the elements of the array. We can do this by placing `i` in brackets following the array's name. Let's see this in action in the console. 

  ```js 
  { 
    console.log("I am going to zoo to see " + zooAnimals[i] + ".");
  }
  ```
* Open `13-Ins_Iteration/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * In the first loop, our counter variable `i` is initially assigned the value `0`. So, the first log shows the value of `i` is `0`. Then, after the block of code is executed, `i` is incremented. So, when it runs again, `i` is 1 and so on until the condition `i < 5` is no longer `true`. 

  * In the next loop, instead of just console logging `i`, `i` is used to determine the index of the element. So the first time it is run, `zooAnimals[i]` is read as `zooAnimals[0]` and `"Bears"` is logged. When the loop runs again, `i` is equal to 1, so `"Giraffes"` is logged. Doing this, we can use a for loop to quickly iterate over an entire array -- even a huge one -- with just a few lines of code. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would we want to use a loop in our code?  

  * 🙋 We can execute a block of code over and over again.  

  * ☝️ How do we stop a loop from executing? 

  * 🙋 A loop will stop executing when the condition is `false`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Iteration/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Iteration (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Iteration/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗️ Iterate Over an Array to Log Messages to Console

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a member of the class, I want to store a list of my classmates and use that list to create a greeting for each student on the list. 

## Instructions

* It is done when the names of five classmates are stored in a single variable named `students`.

* It is done when the total number of elements in the `students` array is logged to the console. 

* It is done when using a for loop the greeting "Great to see you, CLASSMATE_NAME" logs to the console for each classmate's name in the `students` array. 

## 💡 Hint

How can you use the element's index and the array name to access each element? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What’s a while loop?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: Iteration (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with iteration? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ For statement 

  * ✔️ Array iteration

* Open `14-Stu_Iteration/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We start by creating a `students` array that holds five names. 

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * We then use the `length` property to find the total number of elements in the `students` array. This length property will come in handy when we set the condition for our loop. 

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * 🔑 To write our for loop, we start with `for` followed by parentheses `()`. Inside the parentheses, we will add three statements separated by a semi-colon `;`.
  
  ```js
  for(var i=0; i < students.length; i++)
  ```
  
  *  The first statement assigns the value of `i` to `0`. 

  ```js
  var i =0;
  ```

  * 🔑 The second statement is a condition that uses the `students` array's `length` to determine when to stop. If this condition evaluates to `true`, the loop will continue executing. If not, the loop will stop. Since we want it to iterate over the entire array, we set the condition to `i < students.length`.

  ```js
  i < students.length;
  ```

 * Finally, after the block of code is executed, we want `i` to increment by `1` so we use `++`.

 ```js
 i++
 ```

* 🔑 To console log each element in the array, we use the array name and `i`. This code block will execute again and again until the condition `i < students.length` is false, iterating over each element in the array.  

```js
console.log("Great to see you, " + students[i]);
```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How is iterating over an array useful to our code?  

  * 🙋 By iterating over an array, we can perform an action on each element of the array quickly and with just a few lines of code. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: For](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Functions (5 mins) 

* Open `15-Ins_Functions/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 We can create reusable blocks of codes using functions.

  * 🔑 One way we can define a function is to use a function declaration. A function declaration starts with the keyword `function` followed by a name and parentheses `{}`.

  ```js
  function declareHello()
  ```
  * 🔑 The block of code we want to execute goes in curly brackets `{}`. Then after the code we want to execute, we use `return`. The return statement stops the execution of the function.   

  ```js
  function declareHello() { 
  console.log("Hello, I am a function declaration.");
  console.log("-----------------------------------");
  return;
  }
  ```
  * 🔑 We can also use `var` to declare a function expression. After the assignment operator `=`, we use `function` followed by parentheses `()`. Just like before, the code block goes in curly brackets `{}` and `return` is used.

  ```js
  var expressHello = function() { 
  console.log("Hello, I am a function expression.");
  console.log("-----------------------------------");
  return;
  };
  ```
  * 🔑 When we define a function, we are simply giving a block of code a name. To execute the function, we call it using the function's name and parentheses `()`. 

  ```js
  declareHello(); 
  expressHello();
  ```

  * 🔑 Functions can also take parameters! Parameters allow us to pass values into a function by giving the values a name. In the example below, the values we want to use in the code block are given the names `x`, `y`,  and `z`. 

  ```js
  function declareHelloAgain(x,y,z) { 
  console.log("Hello, my parameter's values are " + x + ", " + y + ", and " + z);
  console.log("-----------------------------------");
  return;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Adding parameters inside the `()`, only gives them names, not values! The values are assigned when the function is called. So in this case `x` has been assigned `7`, `y` has been assigned `"Hello"` and `z` has been assigned `true`. 

  ```js
  declareHelloAgain(7, "Hello", true);
  ```

* Open `15-Ins_Functions/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following: 

  * Calling the functions executes the code block one time. To execute the block of code again, simply call the function again. This makes the code block easily reusable. 

  * By providing values for `x`, `y`, and `z` when we call `declareHelloAgain`, the values can be accessed by the function and "Hello, my parameter's values are 7, Hello, and true" is logged. 
  
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are two ways that we can use to create a reusable block of code? 

  * 🙋 We can create a function declaration or a function expression.

   * ☝️ How do we execute a function? 

  * 🙋 Declaring a function only gives a block of code a name. To execute it, we have to call it every time we want the action performed. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Functions/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Functions (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Functions/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗️ Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* In this activity, you will work with a partner to write a function that takes in two values and evaluates equality.

## Instructions

* It is done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality. 

* It is done if "They are equal in type and value" is logged if the values are strictly equal. 

* It is done if "They are equal in value" is logged if the two values are equal but not strictly equal.

* It is done if "The values are not equal" if the values are not equal or strictly equal. 

## 💡 Hints
 
How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate with our function? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is hoisting?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Functions (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with functions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Function declaration

  * ✔️ Parameters

  * ✔️ Return

  * ✔️ Function calls

  * ✔️ Function expressions

* Open `16-Stu_Functions/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 To create a function declaration, we start with the keyword `function` and give it a name `isEqual`. Then, inside the parentheses`()`, we provide two parameters `x` and  `y` to provide a name for the two values we want the function to evaluate. 

  ```js
  function isEqual(x,y)
  ```

  * We put our code block in curly brackets `{}` and use an if statement to evaluate if the value assigned to `x` is strictly equal the value assigned to `y`. If so, then `"They are equal in type and value"` will log. 

  ```js
  if (x === y) {
      console.log("They are equal in type and value");
    }
  ```

  * If our two values are not strictly equal, we need to check if they are equal in value. So, we add an else if statement that will log `"They are equal in value"` if `x == y` evaluates to `true`. 

  ```js
  } else if (x == y) {
       console.log("They are equal in value");
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an else statement to log a message if the two values are not strictly equal or equal and add a `return` to stop the execution of the function.

  ```js
  } else {
      console.log("They are not equal");
    }
    return;
  ```

  * 🔑 We execute the block of code by calling it with its name. Inside the parentheses, we put the two values we want to assign to `x` and `y` when the function runs.

  ```js
  isEqual(10, 10);
  ```

 * 🔑 We can also use a function expression to execute the same block of code. A function expression starts with `var`. Both functions will do the same thing.

 ```js
 var isEqualTakeTwo = function (x,y) {
    if (x === y) {
       console.log("They are equal in type and value");
    } else if (x == y) {
      console.log("They are equal in value");
    } else {
      console.log("They are not equal");
    }
    return;
 };
 ```

* Open `16-Stu_Functions/Solved/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When a function is called, the values assigned inside the parentheses `()` are used to execute the code.  

  * So when we assign the values `10` and `10`, `"They are equal in type and value"` logs to the console.

  * When we assign the values `10` and `true`, `"They are not equal"` logs. 


* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can using functions help improve our code? 

  * 🙋 Functions are reusable blocks of code that we can execute again and again. Using functions makes our code more modular and cleaner. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
