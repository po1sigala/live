# 03.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Arrays and Functions

## Overview 

This class is a continuation of JavaScript fundamentals. Arrays, iteration, and array methods are introduced. In addition, function expressions, function declarations, and scope are also explored.     

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_Arrays` through `20-Stu_Methods`.

* Take a few minutes before class to review the activities of the day and think about questions students with a limited exposure to JavaScript may ask. 

* In `19-Stu_Scope`, students are asked to work with a partner to debug some broken code to learn more about scope and shadowing. This is a challenging activity especially for learners new to programming languages. Please make sure to look through the solution code prior to class and think about the questions that may arise. If need be, review [MDN Web Docs; Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) so you can confidently answer students questions. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to: 

* Create an array and access data elements using index

* Iterate over an array using a for-loop

* Write a function expression and a function declaration

* Identify the difference between global and local scope

* Array methods

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Show the students the number `4,294,967,295`. 

* Do not provide students further context at this point. The goal is to pique the learners’ curiosity. 

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think the number `4,294,967,295` represents in JavaScript? 

  * 🙋 `4,294,967,295` is the maximum number of values that can be stored in a single variable in JavaScript. 

* Explain that so far, we have been using variables to store a single value like `"Hello, World"`, `5` or `true` and peforming an action on that single value. However, that is not very efficient! During today's class, we are going to think bigger and learn how to store multiple values in a single array, perform an action on all the values stored with just a few lines of code and even write reusable code blocks that we can use again and again in our program. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Arrays (5 mins) 

* Open `11-Ins_Array/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Previously, we learned to use `var` and the assignment operator `=` to store a single value in a variable. 

  ```js
  var name = "Andre";
  var pets = 3; 
  var isStudent = true;
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays are also declared using `var` and `=` but the data is contained in brackets `[]`

  * 🔑 Inside the brackets, the data is separated by a comma `,`.

  ```js
  var names = ["Andre", "Karl", "Rashida", "Olivia"];
  ```

  * 🔑 To access the entire array, we use the array's name.

  ```js
  console.log(names);
  ```

  * 🔑 To access a single value or element in an array, we use the item's index or place in the array.  

  ```js
  console.log(names[1]);
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays are zero-indexed! So the first value in an array has an index of `0`, not `1`.

  ```js
  console.log(names[0]); 
  ```

  * 🔑 The index can also be used to replace a value in the array.

  * 🔑 In the `names` array, the string `"Olivia"` has an index of 3. So, this logs `Olivia`.

  ```js
  console.log(names[3]);
  ```

  * 🔑 When we re-assign `names[3]` to a new string `"Carter"` and console log it again, `Carter` is logged.

  ```js
  names[3] = "Carter"; 

  console.log(names[3])
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays also have properties. We can find the total number of elements in the array using the `length` property. Since, the `names` array has four elements, this will return `4`. 

  ```js
  console.log(names.length)
  ```

  {TODO re-arrange activity}

  * Open `11-Ins_Array/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  ```js

  ```





* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

### 3. Student Do: Arrays (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# 🏗️Log Welcome Messages to Console Using an Array

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an instructor, I want to create a group of my students' names and use the data from that group to welcome each of my students to class. I also want to remove a student who has left the class and replace the name with a new student's name. 

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It is done when I log the length of the `students` array and the total number of names in the array is logged.  

* It is done when I log "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME" using each name in the array. 

* It is done when the first student name in the array is removed and that name is replaced with the another name.

* It is done when "REPLACED_NAME is in class" is logged when I use an `if statement` to test if the first name in the array has been replaced. 

* It is done when "STUDENT_NAME is still in class" is logged when an `else statement` is added to the `if statement` to log a response if the first name in the array has not been replaced.  

## 💡 Hint

What is the first index in an array? Is is `0` or `1`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could you use the array's length property to access the last element in an array of any length?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Arrays (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with `@TODO TOPIC`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ @TODO { THIS }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

  ```
  @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
  ```

  * 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.
