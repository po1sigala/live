# 03.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Arrays and Functions

## Overview 

This class is a continuation of JavaScript fundamentals. Arrays, iteration, and array methods are introduced. In addition, function expressions, function declarations, and scope are also explored.     

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_Arrays` through `20-Stu_Methods`.

* Take a few minutes before class to review the activities of the day and think about questions students with a limited exposure to JavaScript may ask. 

* In `19-Stu_Scope`, students are asked to work with a partner to debug some broken code to learn more about scope and shadowing. This is a challenging activity especially for learners new to programming languages. Please make sure to look through the solution code prior to class and think about the questions that may arise. If need be, review [MDN Web Docs; Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope) so you can confidently answer students questions. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to: 

* Create an array and access data elements using index

* Iterate over an array using a for-loop

* Write a function expression and a function declaration

* Identify the difference between global and local scope

* Array methods

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Show the class the number `4,294,967,295`. 

* Do not provide students further context at this point. The goal is to pique the learners’ curiosity. 

* Ask the class the following question (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do you think the number `4,294,967,295` represents in JavaScript? 

  * 🙋 `4,294,967,295` is the maximum number of values that can be stored in a single variable in JavaScript. 

* Explain that so far, we have been using variables to store a single value like `"Hello, World"`, `5` or `true` and peforming an action on that single value. However, that is not very efficient! JavaScript is capable of much more, even working with billions of values. 

* Stress that during today's class, we are going to build on our JavaScript skills to think bigger and learn how to store multiple values in a single array, perform an action on all the values stored with just a few lines of code and even write reusable code blocks that we can use again and again in our programs. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Arrays (5 mins) 

* Open `11-Ins_Array/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Previously, we learned to use `var` and the assignment operator `=` to store a single value in a variable. 

  ```js
  var name = "Andre";
  var pets = 3; 
  var isStudent = true;
  ```

  * 🔑 To store multiple values, we also use `var` and `=`. But this time, we use brackets `[]` to hold our values. The values, or elements, are separated by a comma `,`.

  ```js
  var names = ["Andre", "Karl", "Rashida", "Olivia"];
  ```

  * 🔑 To access the entire array, we use the array's name.

  ```js
  console.log(names);
  ```

  * 🔑 To access a single element in an array, we use the item's index or place in the array. Using the index `1`, will log `Karl`. 

  ```js
  console.log(names[1]);
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays are zero-indexed! So the first element in an array has an index of `0`, not `1`. Using `0` will log `Andre`.

  ```js
  console.log(names[0]); 
  ```

  * 🔑 An element's index can also be used to replace a value in the array.

  * 🔑 In the `names` array, the string `"Olivia"` has an index of `3`. So, this logs `Olivia`.

  ```js
  console.log(names[3]);
  ```

  * 🔑 When we re-assign `names[3]` to a new string `"Carter"` using the assignment operator `=`, `"Carter"` is logged. 

  ```js
  names[3] = "Carter"; 

  console.log(names[3])
  ```

  * 🔑 Arrays also have properties. We can find the total number of elements in the array using the `length` property. Since, the `names` array has four elements, this will return `4`. 

  ```js
  console.log(names.length)
  ```

* Open `11-Ins_Array/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * When we log an array to the console using its name, the values surrounded by brackets is returned.

  * When we click on the arrow to the left of the data, the indices of each element is seen. The first element has an index of `0`. The last element has an index of `3`.

  * The length of the `student` array is `4`. Since arrays are zero-indexed, the length is not equal to the highest index. It is the equal to the highest index plus one.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we store multiple values in a variable?

  * 🙋 We use an array. 

  * ☝️ How do we access an element in the array? 

  * 🙋 We use the index.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Arrays/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Arrays (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Arrays/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# 🏗 Log Welcome Messages to Console Using an Array

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an instructor, I want to create a group of my students' names and use the data from that group to welcome each of my students to class. I also want to remove a student who has left the class and replace the name with a new student's name. 

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It is done when I log the length of the `students` array and the total number of elements in the array is logged.  

* It is done when I log "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME" using each element in the array. 

* It is done when the first element in the array is removed and that element is replaced with the name of a new student.

* It is done when "REPLACED_NAME is in class" is logged when I use an `if statement` to test if the first element in the array has been replaced. 
 
## 💡 Hint

What is the first index in an array? Is is `0` or `1`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could you use the array's length property to access the last element in an array of any length?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Arrays (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with arrays? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Create array

  * ✔️ Array length

  * ✔️ Access array element

  * ✔️ Replace array element

* Open `12-Stu_Arrays/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 When creating an array, we use brackets `[]` to hold the data and separate the data with commas `,`.

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * 🔑 We determine the length of the `student` array using the array name followed by `length`.

  ```js
  console.log(students.length);
  ```

  * 🔑 We access an element in the array using the element's index. The first element's index is `0`. 

  ```js
  console.log("Welcome to the class " + students[0]);
  ```

   * 🔑 We replace an element in the array by using the element's index and the assignment operator `=` followed by the new value. This replaces the first element in the array with the string `"Bob"`.

  ```js
  students[0] = "Bob";
  ```

  * We test if the first value has been replaced using an if statement that evaluates if `students[0]` equals `"Bob"`.

  ```js
  if (students[0] === "Bob") {
    console.log(students[0] + " is in class!");
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does it mean that arrays are zero-indexed? 

  * 🙋 The first element of the array has an index of `0` not `1`.

  * ☝️ What property can we use if we went to determine the total number of elements in an array? 

  * The array's length property

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Iteration (5 mins) 

* Open `13-Ins_Iteration/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use for loops to execute a block of code more than once.

  * 🔑 A for loop starts with the keyword `for` followed by parentheses `()`. Inside the parentheses are three statements. The first assigns `i` a starting value. The second provides the condition when the loop should run. The third statement either increments or decrements `i`.

  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) 
  ```

  * 🔑 The block of code that will be repeated goes in curly brackets `{}`.

  ```js
  {
    console.log("This is the current value of i: " + i + ".");
  }
  ```
  * 🔑 We can use for loops to perform an action on each element in an array with just a few lines of code. 
  
  * 🔑 To determine how many times the block of code should repeat, we use the array's length to set the condition. So, as long as `i` is less than the length of the `zooAnimals` array, the loop will continue on. 
  
  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < zooAnimals.length; i++) 
  ```
  * 🔑 We can also use `i` to access and perform an action with each of the array's elements.

  ```js 
  { 
    console.log("I am going to zoo to see " + zooAnimals[i] + ".");
  }
  ```
* Open `13-Ins_Iteration/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * As seen in the logs, the first time the block of code executes, the value of `i` is the starting value, `0`. The next time the block executes, `i` is incremented by  `1`, so `i` is `1`. This continues while the condition is `true` or as long as `x < 5`.

  * So when we use `i` to access an array element, the first time `zooAnimals[i]` logs, the element with the index `0` or `"Bears"`is logged. The second time, since `i` is now `1`, `"Giraffes"` is logged and so forth, as long as the the condition `i < zooAnimals.length` remains true.  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Iteration/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Iteration (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Iteration/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗️ Iterate Over an Array to Log Messages to Console

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a member of the class, I want to store a list of my classmates and use that list to create a greeting for each student on the list. 

## Instructions

* It is done when the names of five classmates are stored in a single variable named `students`.

* It is done when the total number of elements in the `students` array is logged to the console. 

* It is done when using a for loop the greeting "Great to see you, CLASSMATE_NAME" logs to the console for each classmate's name in the `students` array. 

## 💡 Hint

How can you use the element's index and the array name to access each element? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What’s a while loop?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: Iteration (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with Iteration? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ For Loop 

  * ✔️ Array iteration

* Open `14-Stu_Iteration/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We start by creating a `students` array that holds five names. 

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * We then use the `length` property to find the total number of elements in the `students` array. This length property come in handy when we set the condition for our loop. 

  ```js
  var students = ["Sarah", "Orlando", "Heather", "Ismael", "Hung"];
  ```

  * 🔑 To write our for loop, we start with `for` followed by parentheses `()`. Inside the parentheses, we will add three statements
  
  ```js
  for(var i=0; i < students.length; i++)
  ```
  
  * 🔑 Inside the `()`parentheses, we add a starting point, in our case, we want the starting point to be `0`, so we assign `i` the value `0`.

  ```js
  var i =0;
  ```

  * 🔑 Next, still inside the parentheses, we write the condition that determines if the loop should execute. We want the loop to execute as long as `i` is less than the total number of elements in the `students` array, so we use the `length` property. 

  ```js
  i < students.length;
  ```

 * Finally, after the block of code is executed, we want `i` to increment by `1`. This is the third statement placed in the parentheses. 

 ```js
  i++
```

*
