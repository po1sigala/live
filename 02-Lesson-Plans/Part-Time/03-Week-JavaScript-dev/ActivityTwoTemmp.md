### 5. Instructor Demo: Hello Variable (5 mins) 

* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. Following the `var`, the variable is given a unique name, or identifier.

  ```
        var studentName;

  ```

  * Declaring a variable only gives it a name. To assign a value, use the `=` assignment operator followed by the value you want the variable to hold. 

  ```
        var studentName = "Abdul";
        var studentAge = 32;

  ```

  * The `=` assignment operator is also used to re-assign a new value to a variable. Use the variable's name followed by `=` and the new value. Since the variable has already been declared, there is no need to use `var` again.

  ```
        studentName = "Tonya";
        studentAge = 52;

  ``` 

* Variable names are used to access the value the variable holds. 

* In the previous activity, we put a value directly into the `()` in a console log function to log a message. Since the value entered is `"My name is "` then that value logs to the console. 

```
console.log("My name is ");

```
* To log the value stored in a variable, use the variable's name to access the value it holds. Since the value of `studentName` has been re-assigned to the value `Tonya`, the value `Tonya` logs to the console. 

```
console.log(studentName);

```
 
* It is also possible to combine the value `"My name is "` and the value stored in the `studentName` variable into a single console log. Use the concatenation operator `+` to combine the values and log the message "My name is Tonya".

```
console.log("My name is " + studentName);

```

* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Since the value `"My name is "` is written directly between the `()`, the message `My name is ` is logged.

  * Since the variable `studentName` is written in between the `()`, the variable's current value `Tonya` is logged. 

  * Combining the value `"My name is "` and the value stored in the `studentName` variable with a `+` logs "My name is Tonya". 


* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What keyword is used to declare a variable? 

  * 🙋 The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. 

  * ☝️ What operator is used to assign a value to a declared variable?  

  * 🙋 The `=` assignment operator is used to assign and re-assign a value to variable that has already been declared. 

  * ☝️ How do you access the value assigned to a variable?  

  * 🙋 Use the variable's name.  


* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

### 6. Student Do: Hello Variable (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Hello-Variable/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Hello Variable 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to write introductions in the console using console.log() and variables.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Unsolved/script.js]() to implement the following features:

  * As a class member, I want to input name, number of pets, and a fun fact about myself and log an introduction to the console. Then, by only re-assigning the variables, I want to introduce my partner.

  * When I store a name in a variable called `name`, then it should log this introduction line to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

  * When I store a number in a variable called `pets`, then it should log this introduction line to the console:  "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS` pet(s)."

  * When I store a fun fact in variable called `funFact`, then it should log this introduction line to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT`"

  * When I re-assign the values of `name`, `pets` and `funFact` with my new partner's information the introduction messages above should reflect the new values.

* Open [index.html](04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Unsolved/index.html) to implement the following features:

  * When I open the HTML file in the browser and go to the console, the logs should appear. 

## 💡 Hint

The `+` operator is used to combine values in a single console log message.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you concatenate two or more variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: Hello Variable (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with JavaScript variables? (Poll via Fist of Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Variable declaration

  * ✔️ Value assignment

  * ✔️ Accessing stored values

* Open `@TODO/folder/` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * Variables are declared using `var` and assigned a value using `=`.

  ```
    var name = "Sakura";

  ```

   * The variable's values are accessed using the variable name. Since the variables have assigned the values XXX, XXX, XXXX, that is the values that are used in the console logs below.  

  Add code here

  ```

  * Re-assign a variable's value using  `=`. The `var` keyword is not used during re-assignmment because the variable has already been declared.

  ```
    name = "Mateo";

  ```

* After the variables are re-assigned, using the variable names will access the new values XXX XXX XXX XXXX when logged. 

```

Add code here

```

 * To form the longer, combined messages found in the introductions the concatenation operator `+` is used to combine values into a single message. 


  ```
   console.log("Fun fact: " + funFact);

  ```

* Open`01-Ins_Script-ConsoleLog\Solved\index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console. 

    * Note that the logs created by using `+` appear as a single message in the console. 

    * In the first introduction, the console logs use the values stored in variables as originally assigned (XXX, XXX, and XXXX). 

    * Then, point out that the second introduction, the console logs uses the new values  since the variable's values have been re-assigned (XXX,XXX, XXXX) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

    * ☝️ How do you re-assign a new value to a variable?  

    * 🙋 You can re-assign a variable's value by using tha assignment operator `=`. You do not need to use `var` since the variable is already declared. 

    * ☝️ How do you console log the value stored in a variable? 

    * 🙋 To access the value stored in a variable, use the variable's name. To console log the value, the variable name is placed inside the `()`. 

     * ☝️ How do you think the ability to re-assign values to a variable may be useful in your code? 

    * 🙋 The ability to re-assign values to variables makes your code more flexible and reusable. In the activity we just completed, we were able to log new messages simply by re-assigning the values stored in the variables. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs: Storing the Information You Need -- Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
