### 5. Instructor Demo: Hello Variable (5 mins) 

* Open `O3-Ins_Hello-Variable/script.js` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The `var` keyword is used to declare a variable. Following the `var`, the variable is given a unique name, or identifier.

  ```
        var student;

  ```

  * Declaring a variable only gives it a name. To assign a value, use the `=` assignment operator followed by the value you want the variable to hold. 

  ```
        var student = "Abdul";
        var age = 32;

  ```

  * The `=` assignment operator is also used to re-assign a new value to a variable. Use the variable's name followed by `=` and the new value you want the variable to hold. Since the variable has already been declared, there is no need to use `var` again.

  ```
        student = "Tonya";
        age = 52;

  ``` 

* To access the value stored in a variable, use the variable's name. 

* In the previous activity, we put a value directly into the `()` in a console log function to log a message. This logs the value `"student"`.

```
console.log("student");

```
* To log the value stored in the `student` variable instead, use the variable's name without quotes. This will log `Tonya`, the current value held in the `student` variable.

```
console.log(student);

```

* Often, we want the value stored inside a variable to be part of a longer message logged to the console. To do this, use the concatenation operator `+`,  This will log the value `"student"` combined with the the value `": "`and the value stored in the `student` variable, which is currently `Tonya`.

```
console.log("student" + ": " + student);

```

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * 🔑 @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

### 6. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
@TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: { ACTIVITY NAME } (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with `@TODO TOPIC`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ @TODO { THIS }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

  ```
  @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
