# 19.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to Workbox, Caching and Service Workers

## Overview

IN this class, students will learn how to use the workbox library to cache and serve static assets. Students will also become familiar with the different methods workbox provides to create a service worker. Additionally, students will some of the caching strategies that workbox provides out of the box.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `11-Ins_WebPack-HMR` through `20-Stu_Client-Server`.

* This unit features activities that will require students to save and refresh the browser in order to see changes. The very nature of progressive web apps means that by design, students will likely run into issues with cached assets interfering while debugging and testing. **Important**: If you are having issues with cached assets, please use a private or incognito window to view the application.

  * For Chrome users, you can open an incognito window by clicking the three dots in the top right corner of the browser. From there, click the "New Incognito Window" button. You can also use the hot keys on a Mac to open an incognito window, by pressing Command + Shift + N. For Windows users you can use the hot keys by pressing Control + Shift + N.

  * For Firefox users, you can open a private tab by clicking the three dots in the top right corner of the browser. From there, click the "New Private Tab" button. You can also use hot keys on a Mac to open a private tab, by pressing Command + Shift + T. For Windows users you can can do the same by pressing Control + Shift + T.

* In addition to using a private window, students can troubleshoot the caching issues further by completely unregistering the service worker. This will allow the browser to cache the assets again. Details on how to do this will vary between browsers, but generally you can find the option to do this in the browser's developer tools.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement service workers to a web application.

* Leverage caching strategies to optimize performance.

* Execute a full-stack application with a server and client-side development server

> **Important**: If this lesson occurs on a Saturday, make sure to adjust the activities to accommodate for the extra hour of class time. Feel free to take your time as you go through the activities; for example, you can add 5 minutes to the `Student Do` and `Instructor Review` sections as you see fit. Remember to take a 40-minute break at noon!

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Progressive web apps and service workers first appeared in the browser in 2015. The concept however was first discussed by Steve Jobs in 2007 just 18 days before the shipping the first iPhone. At the time, Steve Jobs had envisioned a way to create web applications that look and behave like native apps. The idea was to leverage the browser's native APIs to create a web application that would be able to run on any device. We now know that history played out differently with the advent of the app store, but the concept remains relevant today.

  * You can take a look at this moment in history by watching the following video: ["One Last Thing" by Steve Jobs at WWDC 07](https://youtu.be/ZlE7dzoD6GA)

* It wasn't until 2015 that Google took that concept and gave it some life. The first progressive web app (PWA) specification was introduced at the Chrome Dev summit in 2015. Shortly after, developers started to use the specification to create web applications. Some of the most notable examples of progressive web apps are Twitter, Uber, and Google Maps. All touting reduced data consumption of about 70% or more.

* Fast forward to today, creating a progressive web app is a lot easier than it was back then, and is usually a lot more cost effective than developing a mobile application. Google has created an amazing set of tools called Workbox designed to help developers create a service workers with minimal effort.

* In this unit, you learn about service workers and how to use them to cache assets, improve performance, and serve static assets. We will take a look at one that was made from scratch using vanilla Javascript, and another that was built on top of Workbox.

* First we will cover the project setup needed to replace modules on the fly, how to generate a service worker using Workbox, and finally how to implement caching strategies that make your app faster, and if configured correctly, to work offline.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Hot Module Replacement (5 min)
