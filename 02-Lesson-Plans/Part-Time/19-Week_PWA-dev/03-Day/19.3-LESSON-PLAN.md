# 19.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: IndexedDB and PWAs

## Overview 

In today's class, students will have a chance to learn about a low-level API called IndexedDB which gives us the ability to store large amounts of data on the client side. We have used `localstorage` in the past for client-side storage but we are very limited in how we store data and the type of data we can store using `localstorage`. IndexedDB can help us make more complex data structures and storage using just the client.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_IndexedDB` through `28-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* All of the activities besides the `28-Stu_Mini-Project` solely use a front-end. The `28-Stu_Mini-Project` requires a back end for us to successfully deploy the project to Heroku.

* We are dealing with client and web caching so make sure to clear your cookies regularly before each activity starts or take advantage of the [Incognito window from Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20use%20a,Press%20%E2%8C%98%20%2B%20Shift%20%2B%20n.).

* For all of the activities, we will be using [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to open the `index.html` so make sure to have it installed.

* PWAs and IndexedDB can be frustrating at times so take some time to familiarize with the behavior of each activity. This is also a good opportunity for students to practice troubleshooting unexpected behaviors in their application.

* Make it fun because after this unit students are starting on the Herculean task of learning React.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement IndexedDB inside of a JavaScript application.

* Implement CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE commands for an IndexedDB instance.

* Convert an existing application into a Progressive Web Application (PWA).

* Deploy a Progressive Web Application to Heroku.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* @TODO The first building block of every class is used to stoke curiosity on the topic. Refer to the Activity Planner for the Stoke Curiosity activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: IndexedDB (5 min) 

* Open `21-Ins_IndexedDB/assets/js/database.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * üîë We have to install `idb` package and import it in to the `database.js` file, as shown below:

  ```js
  import { openDB } from 'idb';
  ```

  * The `idb` package is a lightweight wrapper that takes care of some of the more messy parts of IndexedDB. The main reason we are using `idb` package  is it allows us to take advantage of Async / Await.

  * We have created an asynchronous function called `initDB()` which will immediately the `OpenDB` method we imported earlier, as shown in the following:

  ```js
  const initdb = async () =>
    openDB('demo-db', 1, {
    
  });
  ```

  * üîë The first argument is the name of the database we want to which is `demo-db`, follwed by that we have the version number.

  * The version number allows us to check if our user is using an old version of our schema. This will be our one and only schema so we will not have to worry about changing versions.

  * üîë Next, we set the correct schema using the `upgrade` method, as shown in the following:

   ```js
    const initdb = async () =>
      openDB('demo-db', 1, {
        upgrade(db) {
        if (db.objectStoreNames.contains('demo-db')) {
          console.log('demo-db database already exists');
          return;
        }

        db.createObjectStore('demo-db', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true });
        console.log('demo-db database created');
      },
  });
  ```

  * üîë Check to see if user already has the `demo-db` object. If not, create a new one called `demo-db` with the `creaateObjectStore()` method.

  * üîë We use the `keyPath` property to specify the name of key field in the `demo-db` object and set it to auto-increment.

  * Finally, we call the `initDb()` function at the bottom of the `database.js` file, as shown in the following:

  ```js
  initDb()
  ```

* Run `index.html` with Live Server, travel to the `Application` tab in Chrome Dev Tools, and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë In the `Cache Storage` section, if we expand it we can see the `demo-db` storage object.

  * üîë By clicking on the storage object, we can already see the id field even though we have zero records.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã By using the `OpenDB()` from the `idb` package.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_IndexedDB/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: IndexedDB (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_IndexedDB/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìê Add Comments to Implementation of IndexedDB

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in the [database.js](./Unsolved/src/js/database.js) file.

  ## üìù Notes

  To launch the application, follow these steps:

  1. In the command line, navigate to `24-Stu_IndexedDB/Unsolved`.

  2. Run `npm install`.

  3. To launch the application, run `npm run start`.

  4. Open the `index.html` file in the `dist` directory.

  5. To view the IndexedDB store, visit the `Application` tab in Chrome DevTools.


  Refer to the documentation: 

  * [idb NPM Page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb)

  * [MDN Web Docs on the IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)

  ---

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How does an object store in IndexedDB compare to a table or collection in other databases?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: IndexedDB (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with IndexedDB? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Set up IndexedDB

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Create an object store

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Versions

* Open `22-Stu_IndexedDB/Solved/assets/js/database.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We import in the `idb` package and create an asynchronous  `initDB()` function, as shown in the following:

    ```js
    import { openDB } from 'idb';

    const initdb = async () =>
    ```

  * üîë The `idb` package allows us to make IndexedDB asynchronous and cleans up a lot of the messy syntax that IndexedDB has.

  * We call the `OpenDB()` method from the `idb` package, as shown in the following:

  ```js
  const initdb = async () =>
  openDB('todos', 1, {
    upgrade(db) {
      if (db.objectStoreNames.contains('todos')) {
        console.log('todos database already exists');
        return;
      }

      db.createObjectStore('todos', { keyPath: 'id', autoIncrement: true });
      console.log('todos database created');
    },
  });
  ```

  * üîë For the `OpenDB()` method we pass in the name of our database and the version we want to use.

  * üîë Next, we call the `upgrade()` function which takes our database as an argument. Check to see if the object store already exists in the users web browser.

  * üîë Finally, we create a new object store if one doesn't already exist. The object store will always have an `id` `keyPath` that auto increments for us.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does the `keyPath` do?

  * üôã It automatically creates a new key to identify data records that are stored in the database.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Which tab in Chrome Dev Tools can we inspect our object store?

  * üôã The `Application` tab under Cache Storage.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 11. Everyone Do: Git (20 min)

* Open the [Git Docs on Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks) in your browser and explain the following:

  * When working with a team, we often have a certain set of practices that we want everyone to follow when using a repository. Git hooks provide a convenient way to execute custom scripts when a certain action is performed to remind the team of the established rules.

  * For example, if we want to add a reminder to our teammates about the way the commit message should be styled, we can set up a Git hook to listen for a commit event and then execute a script to send an automated reminder.

  * Each Git hook is local to a single repository and we must install the hook in each repository where we want the script to execute.

  * To install a Git hook, we either start with a pre-written sample hook provided by Git or write a custom hook on our own.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Hooks/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be addressed. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We initialize a new repository and enter `ls .git/hooks` to see a list of pre-written sample hooks that Git provides with each new repository:

    ```bash
    mkdir hook-test
    cd hook-test
    git init
    ls .git/hooks
    ```

  * Let's explore one of these hooks. We enter `code .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample` to open the `pre-commit` hook in VS Code.

  * üîë We see that Git hooks are written as shell hooks, and this hook is executed before a commit is made to check if files that use non-ASCII names are being used. To apply this hook to our repository, we simply rename it and remove the `.sample` extension:
  
    ```bash
    mv .git/hooks/pre-commit.sample .git/hooks/pre-commit
    ```

  * üîë We can also write our own custom hooks. To start, we add a new file in the `hooks` directory to hold our custom hook and set the permissions to execute:

    ```bash
    touch .git/hooks/post-checkout
    chmod +x .git/hooks/post-checkout
    code .git/hooks/post-checkout
    ```

  * We then add the shell script logic to set a safe list of issue/feature names, get the current branch, and check if the name matches a name in the safe list:

  ```bash
  #!/bin/sh
  safelist=("main", "develop", "staging")
  branch=$(git branch --show-current)
  if [[ ! ${safelist[*]} =~ "$branch" ]] && [[ ! "$branch" =~ ^(issue/|feature/).* ]]
  then
    echo "Warning!"
    echo 'If feature or issue branch, please use "issue/" or "feature/" prefix.'
  fi
  ```

 * We can now use our new Git hook to set a reminder to use the team's naming convention within the repository.  

* Answer any questions before students go on break.
