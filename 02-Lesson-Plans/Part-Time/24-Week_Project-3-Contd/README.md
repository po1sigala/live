# Unit 24 Instructor Overview: Project 3 Continued

## Overview

In this unit, students will continue to work on their final project and present their final projects to the class at the end of the unit. They'll also finish up their professional materials, including their portfolios, and add their final projects once they've completed them.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/24-Project-3-Contd/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.
