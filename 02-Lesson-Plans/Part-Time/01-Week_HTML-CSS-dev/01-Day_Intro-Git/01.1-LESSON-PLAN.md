# 01.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: 

## Overview 

Today's lesson will introduce students to the tools they need to succeed in the course as well as provide introductory activities aimed at helping students gain familiarity and confidence in the classroom environment. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Command-Line` through `04-Stu_Git`.

* In addition, during the first 70 minutes of class, the University will lead introductory activities and provide important, course-specific information to the students. 

* Depending on the class size and information provided by the University, `Name of Section` may run long or short of the expected time. 

* The `name of section` is set up to be 

* This class introduces students to the class repository. Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have each day's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Gain familiarity in classroom expectations and processes. 

* Install the tools needed for classroom success including VSCode and Slack.

* Perform a `git pull` to download the day's activities from the class repo prior to each class.

* Implement basic terminal commands including `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and `ls`.

* Use `git clone` to create and clone a repository.
