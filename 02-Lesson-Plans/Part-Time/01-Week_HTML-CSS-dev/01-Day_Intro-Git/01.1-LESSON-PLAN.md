# 01.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Welcome and Introduction to Git

## Overview 

Today's lesson introduces students to the tools they need to succeed in the course as well as provide introductory activities aimed at helping students gain familiarity and confidence in the classroom environment. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Command-Line` through `04-Stu_Git`.

* In addition, during the first 70 minutes of class, the University will lead introductory activities and provide important, course-specific information to the students. 

* Depending on the class size and information provided by the University, `Everyone Do: Welcome` may run long or short of the expected time. 

* The `Set-Up and Installation` is designed to be flexible for this reason. If time is short, please direct students to Office Hours with any questions on set-up. If time allows, feel free to use any additional time to help students install the needed tools on their computers.  

* It is expected that each student will do a `git pull` of the class repo to have each day's activities ready and open in VS Code. However, during this first class, some students may not yet have access to the repository or yet know how to use `git pull`, which is introduced during today's activities. For that reason, please have a TA post the activity instructions on Slack and, if possible, share the instruction on the screen during the `Student Do` section of each activity.  

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand classroom expectations and processes and know how to seek out help. 

* Apply computational thinking to coding challenges.

* Install the tools needed for classroom success including VSCode and Slack.

* Implement basic terminal commands including `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and `ls`.

* Use `git clone` to create and clone a repository. 

* Perform a `git pull` to download the day's activities from the class repo prior to each class.

## Class Instruction

### 2. Instructor Do: Stoking Curiosity (10 min)

* Open the [Unit 01 Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z8sfW7b4X32GT31BGZr5FXCeTay9kfyQ6qhICCCiX-I) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **What is Computational Thinking?**: Computational thinking is a way of logically breaking down a problem so that we can develop a step-by-step solution. Key principles of computational thinking include: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm.

  * **What is Decomposition?**: We use `decomposition` to break down a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts.
  
  * **What is Pattern Recognition?**: Once a problem is broken down, we use `pattern recognition` to find similarities and patterns among the the smaller parts. This helps us solve the problem more efficiently.

  * **What is Abstraction?**: Once patterns are recognized, we use `abstraction` to focus on important and relevant information and filter out what is not needed to solve our problem.

  * **What is an Algorithm?**: After the other steps are complete, it is time for a plan. An `algorithm` is a step-by-step set of instructions that provide a solution to the problem.

  * **How Do We Apply Computational Thinking to Solve Coding Challenges?**: We use `user stories` and `acceptance criteria` to clarify the scope of the problem and help break it down into manageable parts.

  * **Identifying Goals and Rewards: User Stories**: We use a `user story` to identify the end goal and communicate how our solution will meet the specified goal. A user story has a specific format:‚ÄúAs a `user`, I want to `do something`, so that I  can `realize a reward`.‚Äù

  * **Getting Specific: Acceptance Criteria**: `Acceptance criteria` provide the conditions that must be met for the goal to be accomplished and the solution accepted by the user. Acceptance criteria define what specific tasks or functions must be done to solve problem presented in user story and have a clear pass/fail result.

  * **Developing a Solution**: Our solution is a step-by-step set of instructions that addresses each acceptance criteria to ensure the user‚Äôs goals are accomplished as described in the user story. 

* Navigate to `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * This week, we will work in groups to build a landing page using HTML and CSS. 

  * This is an opportunity to put our computational thinking skills to work and practice breaking down a coding challenge into more manageable parts and build our solution step-by-step.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we building?

  * üôã We are building a landing page that allows a visitor to the page to enter their contact information.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What tools can we use to apply computational thinking to this coding challenge? 

  * üôã To break down our coding challenge, we use a user story to identify the user's goal and acceptance criteria to define the criteria that must be met to reach this goal. Then, we can formulate a step-by-step solution that meets the goal. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã This project use the fundamentals of web design -- HTML and CSS -- and allows us to practice the computational thinking skills needed to tackle complex coding problems. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Set-Up and Installation (5 min) 

* For this class, we will use a number of tools to help us write and store our code and communicate effectively as a group. To be successful in this course, it is important that you have all these tools installed and know how to effectively use them. 

* Open VSCode and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use a code editor to easily write our code locally. 

  *  VSCode runs on your desktop and comes with built-in support and extensions that allow you create even complex projects right in the editor. 

  *  VSCode can be downloaded free and works on both Windows and Macs.

* Open Slack and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use Slack to communicate as a class. Look at Slack for important course announcements and information. Slack is also used to communicate with your instructional team and your fellow classmates. 

   *  To use our shared Slack workspace, you must accept the invitation sent to you via email by the University.

  * üîë We also use a Slack App called `AskBCS` to reach out to the Learning Assistant team. To install `AskBCS`, click on the `+` next to `Apps` and enter `AskBCS` in the search bar.  

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use GitHub to store versions of our code and collaborate with others. In GitHub, projects are stored in repositories. 
  
  *  To use GitHub, you will need to set-up a free account.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What tools to we use in the classroom to write code, communicate and collaborate with others?

  * üôã We use VSCode, Slack, and GitHub.

* If time allows, break the students into small groups and proceed to `Student Do: Set-Up and Installation Check (15 min)`.

* Otherwise, inform the students that if they need help installing any of the tools discussed, they can reach out to a TA or stay for Office Hours. Then, proceed directly to `BREAK (15 min)`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Set-Up and Installation Check (20 min) 

* During this time, the students will break out into small groups to troubleshoot any installation issues and make sure they have VSCode, Slack, and GitHub up and running on their machines. The instructional team should actively engage with each group and make sure any issues are addressed. If unable to troubleshoot an individual's concerns during the time allotted, refer them to Office Hours.

* Resources:

  * [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

  * [How to Join a Slack Workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace)

  * [Signing Up for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github)

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 5. BREAK (15 min)

### 6. Instructor Demo: Command Line (5 min) 

* Explain that terminal commands are useful ways to navigate between folders, also called directories, quickly and easily. The commands are entered into the terminal or bash. 

* Open your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use `ls` to list the contents of the home directory, including `Desktop`. 

  ```bash
  ls

  * üîë We use `cd` to go down and change into the `Desktop` directory. 

  ```bash
  cd Desktop
  ```

  * üîë To move back up to our previous directory, we use `cd ..`. 

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

* Explain that in addition to navigating between files and directories, we use terminal commands to create and remove directories and files. 

  * üîë We start by checking our working directory with `pwd`. When we print the working directory, it shows us the path.

  ```bash
  pwd
  ```

  * üîë Since we want to create our new folder inside the `Desktop` directory, we navigate down one layer using `cd`.

  ```bash
  cd Desktop
  ```

  * üîë Then, we use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory named `demo-folder`.
 
  ```bash
  mkdir demo-folder
  ```

  * üîë To add a file to our new directory, we use `cd` to navigate into `demo-folder`.

  ```bash
  cd demo-folder
  ```

  * üîë We use `touch` to create a new file inside of `demo-folder`.

  ```bash
  touch index.html
  ```

  * üîë We use `ls` to check that our new file has been successfully added to the directory.

  ```bash
  ls
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use terminal commands to change directories?

  * üôã We use `cd` to go down and change to a new directory. To go back up to the previous directory, we use `cd..`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use terminal commands to create a new file?

  * üôã We use `touch` and the name of the new file we want to create.  

   * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use terminal commands to create a new directory?

  * üôã We use `mkdir` and the name of the new directory we want to create.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md`.

### 7. Student Do: Command Line (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 8. Instructor Review: Command Line (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the command line? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `cd`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `mkdir`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `touch`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `ls`

* Open `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  *  We use the `user story` to identify the goal and reward. The user, a developer, wants to use the command line to make a directory and file using the command line.

  ```md
  As a developer, I want to use the command line to create a directory and file on my computer.
   ```

  *  We use the `acceptance criteria` to identify when the user's goal has been met. To meet the stated user goal, we need to create new directory named `first-day`. Inside that directory, we need to create an `index.html` file. 

   ```md
  * It's done when a new directory named first-day has been created using terminal commands.

  * It's done when the first-day directory contains a file named index.html. The file should also be created using terminal commands.
  ```

* Open your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * Our solution breaks down the steps to meet the goal. 

  * üîë We use `cd` to navigate to Desktop.

  ```bash
  cd Desktop
  ```

  * üîë We use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory inside `Desktop` named `first-day`
  
  ```bash
  mkdir first-day
  ```
  
  * üîë We use `cd` to navigate inside the `first-day` directory we just created.

  ```bash
  cd first-day
  ```

  * üîë We use `touch` to create a new file inside of `first-day`
  
  ```bash
  touch index.html
  ```

  * üîë To test that our user's goal has been met, we use `cd ..` to navigate back to the Desktop and `ls` to list the contents of Desktop.

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ls
  ```

  * We see`first-day` is listed among the contents of the Desktop.

  * To test that a file has been created in our folder, we use `cd` to navigate into the`first-day` directory.

  ```bash
  cd first-day
  ```

  * Then, we use `ls` to list the contents of the directory.

  ```bash
  ls
  ```

  * We see that an `index.html` file is located inside the `first-day` directory.

  * Our solution addresses all the conditions of the `acceptance criteria` and clearly meets the user's goal. Good work! 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What command can we use to create a directory in the command line? 

  * üôã We use `mkdir`

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What command can we use to create a file in the command line? 

  * üôã We use `touch`

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Basic Built-in Terminal Commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#Basic_built-in_terminal_commands), [Bash/Terminal Commands](bash-terminal-commands-cheatsheet.md) and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Git (5 min) 

* Explain that as developers, it is important to be able to store and manage code as well as share it with others. In this class, we will be using a tool called Github. 

* Open [Github](https://github.com/) in your browser. 

  * Note that in this class, we will share code in repositories using Github.

  * Click on the `new` button to demonstrate how to create a new repository.

  * Give the new repository the name `first-day-demo`.

  * Click on `add README` to add a README.md file. 

  * Click on `create repository`.

  * Explain that while the remote repo is now created, we need to pull down the repository to our machine to make changes to it. 

  * Click on the `code` button and select the HTTPS option under clone to copy the URL.

* Open up a terminal on your machine. 

  * üîë We use the terminal command `cd` to navigate to the directory where we want the repository located. 

  ```bash
  cd Desktop

  * üîë We use the git command `git clone` followed by the URL copied from Github to clone the repo to our machine. 

  ```bash
  git clone <url>
  ```

  * üîë The `git clone` command creates a new directory. We navigate into our new directory using `cd`.

  ```bash
  cd first-day-demo
  ```

  * üîë We add an HTML file to our repo using `touch`.

  ```bash
  touch index.html
  ```

  * üîë We use `git add` to add our changes.

  ```bash
  git add .
  ```

  * üîë To commit our changes, we use `git commit -m` and add a message. 

  ```bash
  git commit -m "First commit"
  ```

  * üîë To push our changes back up to the repo we created on Github, we use `git push`.

  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

  * üîë It is important that we keep our local repo up-to-date. To pull down any changes from the repo we created on Github and update the repo on our local machine, we use `git pull`. The `origin` refers to the repo that we cloned and `main` is the branch. The default branch is `main`.

  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we create a new repo on Github and clone it to our local machine?

  * üôã We go to [Github](www.github.com) and create a new repo. Then, we use `git clone` to clone it to our local machine. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we push changes to remote repo so we can see our changes on Github?

  * üôã We use `git add .` to add all our changes. We use `git commit -m` to commit our changes and add a message that explains the changes made. Then, to push the changes we use `git push origin main`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Git/README.md`.
