# 01.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to Command Line and Git

## Overview 

Today's lesson introduces students to the tools they need to succeed in the course as well as provide introductory activities aimed at helping students gain familiarity and confidence in the classroom environment. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Command-Line` through `04-Stu_Git`.

* In addition, during the first 70 minutes of class, the University will lead introductory activities and provide important, course-specific information to the students. 

* Depending on the class size and information provided by the University, `Everyone Do: Welcome` may run long or short of the expected time. 

* The `Set-Up and Installation` is designed to be flexible for this reason. If time is short, please direct students to Office Hours with any questions on set-up. If time allows, feel free to use any additional time to help students install the needed tools on their computers.  

* Remind students that they can always refer to their prework for more detailed instructions on how to install the tools they will need for this course. Most of the set-up and command line/git commands have already been covered in their prework.

* It is expected that each student will do a `git pull` of the class repository to have each day's activities ready and open in VS Code. However, during this first class, some students may not yet have access to the repository or yet know how to use `git pull`, which is introduced during today's activities. For that reason, please have a TA post the activity instructions on Slack and, if possible, share the instruction on the screen during the `Student Do` section of each activity.  

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Understand classroom expectations and processes and know how to seek out help. 

* Apply computational thinking to coding challenges.

* Install the tools needed for classroom success including VS Code and Slack.

* Implement basic terminal commands including `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and `ls`.

* Use `git clone` to create and clone a remote repository. 

* Perform a `git pull` to pull down the day's activities from the class repository prior to each class.

## Class Instruction

### 2. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Open the [Unit 01 Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z8sfW7b4X32GT31BGZr5FXCeTay9kfyQ6qhICCCiX-I/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **What is Computational Thinking?**: Computational thinking is a way of logically breaking down a problem so that we can develop a step-by-step solution. Key principles of computational thinking include: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm.

  * **What is Decomposition?**: We use `decomposition` to break down a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts.
  
  * **What is Pattern Recognition?**: Once a problem is broken down, we use `pattern recognition` to find similarities and patterns among the the smaller parts. This helps us solve the problem more efficiently.

  * **What is Abstraction?**: Once patterns are recognized, we use `abstraction` to focus on important and relevant information and filter out what is not needed to solve our problem.

  * **What is an Algorithm?**: After the other steps are complete, it is time for a plan. An `algorithm` is a step-by-step set of instructions that provide a solution to the problem.

  * **How Do We Apply Computational Thinking to Solve Coding Challenges?**: We use `user stories` and `acceptance criteria` to clarify the scope of the problem and help break it down into manageable parts.

  * **Identifying Goals and Rewards: User Stories**: We use a `user story` to identify the end goal and communicate how our solution will meet the specified goal. A user story has a specific format:‚ÄúAs a `user`, I want to `do something`, so that I  can `realize a reward`.‚Äù

  * **Getting Specific: Acceptance Criteria**: `Acceptance criteria` provide the conditions that must be met for the goal to be accomplished and the solution accepted by the user. Acceptance criteria define what specific tasks or functions must be done to solve problem presented in user story and have a clear pass/fail result.

  * **Developing a Solution**: Our solution is a step-by-step set of instructions that addresses each acceptance criteria to ensure the user‚Äôs goals are accomplished as described in the user story. 

* Navigate to `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * This week, we will work in groups to build a landing page using HTML and CSS. 

  * This is an opportunity to put our computational thinking skills to work and practice breaking down a coding challenge into more manageable parts and build our solution step-by-step.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we building?

  * üôã We are building a landing page that allows a visitor to the page to enter their contact information.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What tools can we use to apply computational thinking to this coding challenge? 

  * üôã To break down our coding challenge, we use a user story to identify the user's goal and acceptance criteria to define the criteria that must be met to reach this goal. Then, we can formulate a step-by-step solution that meets the goal. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã This project use the fundamentals of web design -- HTML and CSS -- and allows us to practice the computational thinking skills needed to tackle complex coding problems. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Set-Up and Installation (5 min) 

* This section is designed to be flexible. If time is short, please direct students to Office Hours with any questions on set-up. If time allows, feel free to use any additional time to help students install the needed tools on their computers.  

  * For this class, we will use a number of tools to help us write and store our code and communicate effectively as a group. To be successful in this course, it is important that you have all these tools installed and know how to effectively use them. 
  
  * You can always refer to your prework for detailed instructions on how to install all the tools and programs we will need for this course.

* Open VS Code and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use a code editor to easily write our code locally. 

  *  VS Code runs on your desktop and comes with built-in support and extensions that allow you create even complex projects right in the editor. 

  *  VS Code can be downloaded free and works on both Windows and Macs.

* Open Slack and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use Slack to communicate as a class. Look at Slack for important course announcements and information. Slack is also used to communicate with your instructional team and your fellow classmates. 

   *  To use our shared Slack workspace, you must accept the invitation sent to you via email by the University.

  * üîë We also use a Slack App called `AskBCS` to reach out to the Learning Assistant team. To install `AskBCS`, click on the `+` next to `Apps` and enter `AskBCS` in the search bar.  

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use GitHub to store versions of our code and collaborate with others. In GitHub, projects are stored in repositories. 
  
  *  To use GitHub, you will need to set up a free account.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What tools to we use in the classroom to write code, communicate and collaborate with others?

  * üôã We use VS Code, Slack, and GitHub.

* If time allows, break the students into small groups and proceed to `Student Do: Set-Up and Installation Check (15 min)`.

* Otherwise, inform the students that if they need help installing any of the tools discussed, they can reach out to a TA or stay for Office Hours. Then, proceed directly to `BREAK (15 min)`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Student Do: Set-Up and Installation Check (20 min) 

* During this time, the students will break out into small groups to troubleshoot any installation issues and make sure they have VS Code, Slack, and GitHub up and running on their machines. 

* The instructional team should actively engage with each group and make sure any issues are addressed. If unable to troubleshoot an individual's concerns during the time allotted, recommend they stay for Office Hours.

* Resources:

  * [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

  * [How to Join a Slack Workspace](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace)

  * [Signing Up for GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-github)

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 5. BREAK (15 min)

### 6. Instructor Demo: Command Line (5 min) 

* Explain that terminal commands are useful ways to navigate between folders, also called directories, quickly and easily. The commands are entered into the terminal or bash. 

* Open your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use `ls` to list the contents of the current directory. In the home directory, we see a list of directories including the `Desktop` directory. 

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

  * üîë We use `cd` to change directories. We can change into the `Desktop` directory with the following command: 

    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```

  * üîë To move back up to our previous directory, we use `cd ..`. 

    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

* Explain that in addition to navigating between files and directories, we can use terminal commands to create and remove directories and files. 

  * Let's create a new directory in `Desktop` with a new file.

  * üîë We start by checking our working directory with `pwd`. When we print the working directory, it shows us the path.

    ```bash
    pwd
    ```

  * üîë Since we want to create our new folder inside the `Desktop` directory, we first navigate down one layer into the `Desktop` directory using `cd`.

    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```

  * üîë Then, we use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory named `demo-folder`.
 
    ```bash
    mkdir demo-folder
    ```

  * üîë To add a file to our new directory, we first use `cd` to navigate into `demo-folder`.

    ```bash
    cd demo-folder
    ```

  * üîë Then, we use `touch` to create a new file called `index.html` inside of `demo-folder`.

    ```bash
    touch index.html
    ```

  * üîë We can use `ls` to check that our new file has been successfully added to the directory.

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use terminal commands to change directories?

  * üôã We use `cd` to go down and change to a new directory. To go back up to the previous directory, we use `cd ..`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use terminal commands to create a new file?

  * üôã We use `touch` and the name of the new file we want to create.  

   * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we use terminal commands to create a new directory?

  * üôã We use `mkdir` and the name of the new directory we want to create.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md`.

### 7. Student Do: Command Line (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üìñ Use Terminal Commands to Create Directory and File

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to use the command line to create a directory and file on my computer. 

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when a new directory named `first-day` has been created using terminal commands.

  * It's done when the `first-day` directory contains a file named `index.html`. The file should also be created using terminal commands.

  ## üìù Notes

  Refer to the documentation: 

  [MDN Web Docs on Basic Built-in Terminal Commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#Basic_built-in_terminal_commands)

  ---

  ## üí° Hints

  * What terminal command can you use to list the contents of a directory? How can you use this command to check your work?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Which terminal command do you use to copy or move files?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 8. Instructor Review: Command Line (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the command line? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `cd`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `mkdir`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `touch`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `ls`

* Open `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  *  We use the user story to identify the goal and reward. The user, a developer, wants to use only the command line to make a new directory and file.

    ```md
    As a developer, I want to use the command line to create a directory and file on my computer.
    ```

  *  We use the acceptance criteria to identify when the user's goal has been met. To meet the stated user goal, we need to create a new directory named `first-day`. Inside that directory, we need to create an `index.html` file. 

    ```md
    * It's done when a new directory named first-day has been created using terminal commands.

    * It's done when the first-day directory contains a file named index.html. The file should also be created using terminal commands.
    ```

* Open your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * Our solution breaks down the steps to meet the goal. 

  * üîë We use `cd` to navigate to `Desktop`.

    ```bash
    cd Desktop
    ```

  * üîë We use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory inside `Desktop` named `first-day`
  
    ```bash
    mkdir first-day
    ```
  
  * üîë We use `cd` to navigate inside the `first-day` directory we just created.

    ```bash
    cd first-day
    ```

  * üîë We use `touch` to create a new file named `index.html` inside of `first-day`.
  
    ```bash
    touch index.html
    ```

  * üîë To test that our user's goal has been met, we use `cd ..` to navigate back to the `Desktop` and `ls` to list the contents of `Desktop`.

    ```bash
    cd ..

    ls
    ```

  * We see the `first-day` directory is listed among the contents of the `Desktop`.

  * To test that a file has been created in our folder, we use `cd` to navigate into the`first-day` directory.

    ```bash
    cd first-day
    ```

  * Then, we use `ls` to list the contents of the directory.

    ```bash
    ls
    ```

  * We see that an `index.html` file is located inside the `first-day` directory.

  * Our solution addresses all the conditions of the acceptance criteria and clearly meets the user's goal. Good work! 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What command can we use to create a directory in the command line? 

  * üôã We use `mkdir`

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What command can we use to create a file in the command line? 

  * üôã We use `touch`

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the MDN Web Docs on [Basic Built-in Terminal Commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#Basic_built-in_terminal_commands), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Instructor Demo: Git (5 min) 

* Explain that as developers, it is important to be able to store and manage code as well as share it with others. In this class, we will be using a tool called GitHub. 

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following. 

  * In this class, we will share code in repositories using GitHub.

  * We click on the green New button on the top left, or the plus `+` icon on the top right, to create a new repository.

  * üîë We type the name of our repository, `first-day-demo`, in the "Repository Name" box.

  * üîë We select Public because all of the repositories we create in this course will need to be public in order to deploy to GitHub Pages and be able to get support from TAs regarding Homework. It is possible to host private repositories with GitHub Pro, but a paid account is not necessary for the successful completion of this course.

  * üîë We check the "Add a README file" checkbox to have GitHub create a new `README.md` file when creating our repository.

  * Finally we click on the "Create repository" button.

  * üîë While the remote repository is now created, we need to pull down the repository to our local machine.

* Navigate to the `first-day-demo` repository we just created in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We click on the Code button and select the HTTPS option (or the SSH option if students have completed their prework and have it set up) to copy the URL.

* Open your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use the terminal command `cd` to navigate to the directory where we want the repository located. Ideally, you should have a parent directory to store all of your coding projects for this course. Let's call the parent directory `Bootcamp` for our example.

    ```bash
    cd Bootcamp
    ```

  * üîë We use the git command `git clone` followed by the URL copied from GitHub to clone the repository to our local machine. 

    ```bash
    git clone <the HTTPS or SSH URL ending in .git>
    ```

  * üîë The `git clone` command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository. We navigate into our new directory using `cd`.

    ```bash
    cd first-day-demo
    ```

  * üîë Let's create an HTML file in our local repository using the `touch` command.

    ```bash
    touch index.html
    ```

  * üîë Before we add our changes to commit them, let's run `git status` to check the status of our repository.

    ```bash
    git status
    ```

  * That will show us which files are being tracked and which are untracked.

  * üîë We use the command `git add` to add our changes. `git add .` adds any untracked or modified files in the current directory (the current directory is represented by `.`) and all subdirectories. 

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

  * üîë If we run `git status` again, now we will see all of our files are being tracked and are ready to be committed.

  * üîë To commit our changes, we use the command `git commit -m` with a commit message, like "First commit". 

    ```bash
    git commit -m "First commit"
    ```

  * üîë To push our changes back up to the repository we created on GitHub, we use the command `git push`. The `git push` command sends any local commits to a remote location. In our case, the location is `origin` (GitHub), and we want to update the origin's `main` branch. For now, you only have one version of your codebase, and it's called `main` by default.

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

  * Historically, the most common name for the main body of a codebase has been `master`. Recently, however, `main` has been gaining in popularity. In fact, GitHub now uses `main` as the default name for its repositories&mdash;as do the projects in this course. Be aware that you might see instances of both throughout your development career, or hear experienced coders use the term "master branch" out of habit. We will cover this more in detail when we do the `21-Evr_Git-Guide` activity.

  * üîë It is important that we keep our local repository up-to-date, especially when collaborating with others. Other collaborators may make changes to the repository that you don't have on your local repository yet.
  
  * üîë To pull down any changes from the remote repository on GitHub and update the local repository on our local machine, we use the command `git pull`. Just like when we did a `git push`, we use `origin` to represent the original directory&mdash;or more precisely the original repository's URL&mdash;followed by the name of the branch, which in `main`.

    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

  * You will be using this `git pull` command before every class to pull down that day's activities from the class repository.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we create a new repository on GitHub and clone it to our local machine?

  * üôã We go to [GitHub](www.github.com) and create a new repository. Then, we use `git clone` to clone it to our local machine. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we push changes to remote repository so we can see our changes on GitHub?

  * üôã We use `git add .` to add all our changes. We use `git commit -m` to commit our changes and add a message that explains the changes made. Then, to push the changes we use `git push origin main`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Git/README.md`.

### 10. Student Do: Git (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Git/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

    * It's done when I have used terminal commands to navigate into the `first-day-repo` directory.

    * It's done when I have used terminal commands to create an `index.html` file.

    * It's done when I add and commit my changes using git commands.

    * It's done when I push the changes to the remote repository. 
    ```
  
  * Our solution is a step-by-step plan that satisfies the user's goal and the conditions set out in the acceptance criteria are met.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * We click on the New button to create a new repository.

  * We give the new repository the name `first-day-repo`.

  * We check the "Add a README file" checkbox to add a `README.md` file to the new repository we are creating. 

  * We click on the "Create Repository" button.

  * We click on the Code button and select the HTTPS or SSH option to copy the URL.

* Open the terminal and demonstrate the following:

  *  We use the terminal command `cd` to navigate to the directory where we want the repository located. 

    ```bash
    cd Bootcamp
    ```

  * üîë We use the git command `git clone` followed by the URL copied from GitHub to clone the repository to our machine. 

    ```bash
    git clone <the HTTPS or SSH URL ending in .git>
    ```

  * We navigate into our new directory using `cd`.

    ```bash
    cd first-day-repo
    ```

  *  We add an HTML file to our repository using `touch`.

    ```bash
    touch index.html
    ```

  * We use `git status` to check the status of our files.

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

  * üîë We use `git add` to add our changes.

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

  * We use `git status` again to make sure our files are being tracked.

  * üîë To commit our changes, we use `git commit -m` and add a commit message. 

    ```bash
    git commit -m "First commit"
    ```

  * üîë To push our changes back up to the repository we created on GitHub, we use `git push`.

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

  * To make sure that we are done, we check to make sure that each acceptance criteria is satisfied and the user's goal is clearly met. When we open [GitHub](https://github.com/), we see there is a repository called "first-day-repository". In that repository is a new file called `index.html`. Good work! 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are the steps to create a repository using GitHub then create a local copy?

  * üôã We create the repository in GitHub and then clone it to our local machine using `git clone` so we get not only the files but also a copy of the history. This will ensure that this local copy is a functional Git repository.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is it a good habit to use `git status` frequently?

  * üôã When we are dealing with large numbers of file, it is easy to lose track of which files are ready to be committed and which are not. Using `git status` will not only show you which files are being tracked but also which branch you're on. You can then choose which files to stage for commit.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we update the repository in GitHub with our local version?

  * üôã We use `git add` to stage the changes and `git commit` to commit the changes. To push the changes to our remote repository, we use `git push`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the GitHub Docs on [Create a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/create-a-repo) and [Cloning a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
