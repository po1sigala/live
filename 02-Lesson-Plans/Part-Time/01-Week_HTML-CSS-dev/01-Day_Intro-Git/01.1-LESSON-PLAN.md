# 01.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Welcome and Introduction to Git

## Overview 

Today's lesson will introduce students to the tools they need to succeed in the course as well as provide introductory activities aimed at helping students gain familiarity and confidence in the classroom environment. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Command-Line` through `04-Stu_Git`.

* In addition, during the first 70 minutes of class, the University will lead introductory activities and provide important, course-specific information to the students. 

* Depending on the class size and information provided by the University, `Everyone Do: Welcome` may run long or short of the expected time. 

* The `Set-Up and Installation` is designed to be flexible for this reason. If time is short, please direct students to Office Hours with any questions on set-up. If time allows, feel free to use any additional time to help students have all the needed tools for classroom success set-up on their machines.  

* This class introduces students to the class repository. Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have each day's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Gain familiarity in classroom expectations and processes. 

* Install the tools needed for classroom success including VSCode and Slack.

* Perform a `git pull` to download the day's activities from the class repo prior to each class.

* Implement basic terminal commands including `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, and `ls`.

* Use `git clone` to create and clone a repository.

## Class Instruction

### 2. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Open the [Unit 01 Slide Deck]() and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **What is Computational Thinking?**: Computational thinking is a way of logically breaking down a problem so that we can develop a step-by-step solution. Key principles of computational thinking include: decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, and algorithm.

  * **What is Decomposition?**: We use decomposition to break down a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts.
  
  * **What is Pattern Recognition?**: Once a problem is broken down, we use pattern recognition to find similarities and patterns among the the smaller parts. This helps us solve the problem more efficiently.

  * **What is Abstraction?**: Once a problem is broken down, we use pattern recognition to find similarities and patterns among the the smaller parts. This helps us solve the problem more efficiently.

  * **What is an Algorithm?**: After the other steps are complete, it is time for a plan. An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions that provide a solution to the problem.

  * **How Do We Apply Computational Thinking to Solve Coding Challenges?**: We use user stories and acceptance criteria to clarify the scope of the problem and help break it down into manageable parts.

  * **Identifying Goals and Rewards: User Stories**: We use a user story to identify the end goal and communicate how our solution will meet the specified goal. A user story has a specific format:“As a [user], I want to [do something], so that I  can [realize a reward].”

  * **Getting Specific: Acceptance Criteria**: Acceptance criteria provide the conditions that must be met for the goal to be accomplished and the solution accepted by the user. Acceptance criteria define what specific tasks or functions must be done to solve problem presented in user story and have a clear pass/fail result.

  * **Developing a Solution**: Our solution is a step-by-step set of instructions that address each of the acceptance criteria and clearly meets the user’s goal and reward as described in the user story. 

* Navigate to `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * This week, we will work in groups to build a landing page using HTML and CSS. 

  * This is an opportunity to put our computational thinking skills to work and practice breaking down a coding challenge into more manageable parts and build our solution step-by-step.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we building?

  * 🙋 We are building a landing page that allows a visitor to the page to enter their contact information.

  * ☝️ What tools can we use to apply computational thinking to this coding challenge? 

  * 🙋 To break down our coding challenge, ee use a user story to identify the user's goal and acceptance criteria to define the criteria that must be met to reach this goal. Then, we can formulate a step-by-step solution that meets the goal. 

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 This project use the fundamentals of web design -- HTML and CSS -- and allows us to practice the computational thinking skills needed to tackle complex coding problems. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Instructor Demo: Set-Up and Installation (5 min) 

* For this class, we will use a number of tools to help us write and store our code and communicate effectively as a group. 

* Open `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main` in VSCode and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use a code editor to write our code locally. 

  * 🔑 VSCode runs on your desktop and comes with built-in support and extensions that allow you create even complex projects right in the editor. 

  * 🔑 VSCode can be downloaded free and works on both Windows and Macs.

* Open Slack and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use Slack to communicate as a class. Look at Slack for important course announcements and information. Slack is also used to communicate with your instructional team and your fellow classmates. 

  * 🔑 We use a Slack App called `AskBCS` to reach out to the Learning Assistant team. To install `AskBCS` click on the `+` next to `Apps` and enter `AskBCS` in the search bar.  

  * 🔑 To use our shared Slack workspace, you must accept the invitation sent to you via email.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use GitHub to store versions of our code and collaborate with others. In GitHub, projects are stored in repositories. 
  
  * 🔑 To use GitHub, you will need to set-up a free account.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What tools to we use in the classroom to write code, communicate and collaborate with others?

  * 🙋 We use VSCode, Slack, and GitHub.

* If time allows, break the students into small groups and proceed to `Student Do: Set-Up and Installation Check (15 min)`.

* Otherwise, inform the students that if they need help installing any of the tools, that they can reach out to a TA or stay for Office Hours and proceed to `BREAK (15 min)`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 3. Student Do: Set-Up and Installation Check (15 min) 

* During this time, the students will break out into small groups to troubleshoot any installation issues. 

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. BREAK (15 min)

### 5. Instructor Demo: Command Line (5 min) 
* Explain that terminal commands are useful ways to navigate between folders, also called directories, quickly and easily. The commands are entered into the terminal or bash. 

* Open your terminal and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use `ls` to list the contents of the home directory, including `Desktop`. 

  ```
  ls
  ```

  * 🔑 We use `cd` to go down and change into the `Desktop` directory. 

  ```
  cd Desktop
  ```

  * 🔑 To move back up to our previous directory, we use `cd ..`. 

  ```
  cd ..
  ```

* Explain that in addition to navigating between files and directories, we use terminal commands to create and remove directories and files. 

  * 🔑 We start by checking our working directory with `pwd`. When we print the working directory, it shows us the path.

  ```
  pwd
  ```

  * 🔑 Since we want to create our new folder inside the `Desktop` directory, we navigate down one layer using `cd`.

  ```
  cd Desktop
  ```

  * 🔑 Then, we use the `mkdir` command to create a new directory named `demo-folder`.
 
  ```
  mkdir demo-folder
  ```

  * 🔑 To add a file to our new directory, we use `cd` to navigate into `demo-folder`.

  ```
  cd demo-folder
  ```

  * 🔑 We use `touch` to create a new file inside of `demo-folder`.

  ```
  touch index.html
  ```

  * 🔑 We use `ls` to check that our new file has been succcessfully added to the directory.

  ```
  ls
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we use terminal commands to change directories?

  * 🙋 We use `cd` to go down and change to a new directory. To go back up to the previous directory, we use `cd..`.

  * ☝️ How would we use terminal commands to create a new file?

  * 🙋 We use `touch` and the name of the new file we want to create.  

   * ☝️ How would we use terminal commands to create a new director?

  * 🙋 We use `mkdir` and the name of the new directory we want to create.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Command Line (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Command-Line/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
