# Unit 01 Instructor Overview: HTML, CSS, and Git  

## Overview

In this unit, you will introduce the students to HTML, CSS, and version control with Git.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* During the first class, you will introduce the tools required for the students to be successful in the course including Slack, VSCode, and GitHub. Please refer to Slack workspace [Set-up Guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace), [VSCode Installation](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) instructions, and [Guide to Setting Up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) to review set-up and installation on both Windows and Mac machines, as needed.

* The students have been provided installation instructions in the pre-work. However, if a student is struggling to get the required tools installed and working, please encourage them to stay for Office Hours for additional help.

* In addition to learning HTML, CSS and Git fundamentals, this week's activities also aim to help students gain familiarity with classroom expectations. Please make sure to reinforce the importance of each student doing a `git pull` of the class repo prior to each class. 

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).
