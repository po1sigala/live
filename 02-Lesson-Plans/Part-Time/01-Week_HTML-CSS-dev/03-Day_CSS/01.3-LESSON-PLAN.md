# 01.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: CSS Layout and the Box Model

## Overview 

Today's lesson will delve further into CSS and introduces the box model and layout using the display and position properties. Students will also work together to complete a mini-project that reinforces HTML and CSS fundamentals.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `15-Ins_HTML-display` through `22-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Be ready to view and edit CSS in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to the Google documentation [Get Started With Viewing And Changing CSS](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/css).

* This week's mini-project builds on the fundamental concepts of HTML and CSS learned this week. Encourage the students to look back on previous activities, as needed, to refresh their memory and for help with syntax.

* This mini-project is also the first experience some students may have with building a coding project from scratch. Remind the students to break down the project into small, manageable steps and to use both the `user story` and `acceptance criteria` as a guide to help arrive at a step-by-step solution. 

* Be prepared to demonstrate creating a Git repository using both `git clone` and `git init`. If needed, please review [Git Basics - Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) prior to class, so you feel prepared to handle any student questions as they arise. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use the CSS display property to set an element as an inline or block element.

* Determine how an element is positioned in an HTML document using the CSS position property.

* Identify the box model and its role in web design and layout.

* Set up a repository with Git.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Explain that when web developers build projects, they often rely on tools to help them troubleshoot issues and build pages faster.

* And one of the most powerful tools is available right in your web browser!

* Navigate to `22-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Open Chrome DevTools by pressing `Command+Option+J (Mac)` or `Control+Shift+J` (Windows, Linux, Chrome OS).

  * Tell the students that Chrome DevTools has many features useful for developers for debugging and even experimenting with the code right in the browser.
  
  * Navigate to the `Styles` tab on the `Elements` panel and note the CSS listed in the panel.
  
  * Hover over a CSS property and click to uncheck the box. Note the change on the webpage.
  
  * Change the `background-color` property in the body to `purple` to further demonstrate how you can manually change a value.
  
  * Explain that changing CSS right in the browser is a great way to experiment with style properties.
  
  * Add that another useful feature of DevTools is that you can check an element's accessibility by simply hovering over the image.
  
  * Click on the pointer icon and then hover over an element on the page. A box should appear that indicates the element's accessibility including the role as read by an accessibility device. If applicable, a contrast score will also be indicated.
  
  * Note that having enough contrast between colors is important to make sure your page is viewable to a range of users. 
  
  * Encourage the students to experiment with Chrome DevTools when they build their own projects later in the class to troubleshoot their CSS and check the accessibility of the elements on their page. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Display (5 min) 

* Open `15-Ins_HTML-display/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 The CSS display property can be used to set an element to display inline or block.

  * 🔑 Inline elements are elements that only take up as much width as needed and do not automatically start a new line.

  * Images and `<a>` elements are examples of elements that are inline elements.
  
  * 🔑 Blocks elements are elements that always start on a new line and take up as much width as available.

  * Paragraph and unordered lists are examples of block elements.

  * 🔑 We use the `display` property to set if an element behaves as an inline or block element. 

  * We can also use display to hide an element.

* Open `15-Ins_HTML-display/assets/css/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use `display: block` to set an element to block. A block element will take up the whole width available.

  ```css
  .display-block {
    display: block;
  }
  ```

  * We use `display: inline` to set an element to inline. An inline element will only take up the width needed. 

  ```css
  .display-inline {
    display: inline;
  }
  ```

  * We use `display: none` to completely remove an image. It will not appear on the page and no longer takes up space in the layout. 

  ```css
  .display-none {
    display: none;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the difference between an inline and block element?

  * 🙋 An inline element will only take up as much width as needed. In contrast, a block element will take up as much width as available. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `15-Ins_HTML-display/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Display (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `15-Ins_HTML-display/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# 🐛 Images and Navigation Bar Items are Not Displaying Correctly

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should be able to see a horizontal navigation bar.

* Users should be able to see three images.

* Users should be able to see one image on each line.

## Expected Behavior

* All list items in the navigation bar should display inline.

* All images should be visible. 

* Each image should appear centered and on its own line.

## Actual Behavior

* Each list item in the navigation bar displays on its own line.

* Two images are visible and one is not displayed.

* The two visible images display inline. 

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![Mockup](./assets/image-1.png)

## 💡 Hints

What display property is used to hide an element? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the CSS visibility property? How is it different from the display property?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

---
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Display (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with @TODO { TOPIC }? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `display: inline`

  * ✔️ `display: block`

  *  ✔️ `display: none`

* Open `16-Stu_HTML-Display/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * In this activity, we are asked to debug broken code so that user's goals, as stated in the user stories, are met and the app behaves as expected.

  * 🔑 Currently, each list item in the navigation bar displays on its own line. To meet the expected behavior and have each list item display inline, we use the the display property to set the behavior to inline.

  ```css
  li {
    display: inline;
    list-style-type: none;
    font-size: 40px;
  }
  ```

  * Images are inline elements. To set them as block elements, we use `display: block`.

  ```css
  img {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 One of the images is set to `display: none`. This means that the image is not visible and is not taking up space. To make the image visible, we use `display: block` to match the expected behavior. 

  ```css
  #image-3 {
    display: block;
  }
  ```
* Open `16-Stu_HTML-Display/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * We open the webpage in the browser to test to make sure the expected behavior is not visible on the screen. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we use the `display` property to change how an element appears on the page?

  * 🙋 We can set an element to `display: inline` so it will only take up as much width as needed. Thi is useful is we want more than one element to appear on the same line. We can set an element to `display: block` so that it takes up the entire width available. This is useful if we only want one element per line. We use `display: none` if we want to completely remove an item. Using `display: none` means it will not be visible and will no longer take up space on the page. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Box Model (5 min) 

* Open `17-Ins_CSS-box-model/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  *  In HTML, all elements are boxes. We use the term `box model` to help describe the amount of space that each element will take in space.

  * The innermost layer of the box is the content itself. The content has height and width.

  * The next layer is the padding that surrounds the content. We use CSS to set the width of the padding. 

  * The border surrounds the padding. Like the padding, the width of the border is set by CSS.

  * Finally, the margin is the area outside the border. 

* Open `17-Ins_CSS-box-model/assets/css/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use CSS to set the width of the padding, border and margins.

  * The CSS `margin` property sets the width of the margin. The top and bottom margins will be 20px. The left and right margins are set to `auto`. 

  ```css
   margin: 20px auto;
  ```

  * The CSS `padding` property sets the width of the padding. All sides will have a width od 20px

  ```css
   padding: 20px;
  ```

  * The border property sets the width of the border, the type of the border and the color.

  ```css
  border: 10px solid darkblue;
  ````

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are the four components of the box model?

  * 🙋 The content, the padding, the border and the margin

  *  ☝️ How is understanding the box model useful for layout and design?

  * 🙋 The box model explains how much space an element will take on a page. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Box Model (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

### 7. Instructor Review: Box Model (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the box model? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ @TODO { THIS }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * To meet the acceptance criteria, we must fit all four image inside the box. 

  * The box has a width of 600px and a height of 600px. For our images to fit inside the box, the total combined space they take up -- including the content, padding, border, and margin -- will have to be less.

    ```css
    section {
      width: 600px;
      height: 600px;
      text-align: center;
      border: 15px solid black;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We set the width and height of the content to be 200px.

  ```css
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  ```


  * 🔑 Next, we set the margin on every side to be 20px. 

  ```css
  margin: 20px;
  ```

  * We set the padding to be 20px as well.

  ```css
  padding: 20px;
  ```

  * Finally, we set the width of the border to be 9px, make it a solid border, and give it a color of light blue.

  ```css
  border: 9px solid darkblue;
  ```
* Open `18-Stu_CSS-box-model/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * The total width of the image is now `20 + 9 + 20  + 200 + 20 + 9 + 20` or 298px.

  * the total height of the image is also 298px.

  * Since the width of the containing box is 600px and the height is 600px, the boxes fit.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the difference between the padding and margin? 

  * 🙋 The padding is the space between the content and the border. Padding surrounds the content. Margins determine the space surrounding an element. Both are often adjusted when designing a layout to make an element fit in a space.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on the Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 min) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * 🔑 @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

### 9. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
@TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 11. Everyone Do: Git (20 min)

* Open [Git Basics - Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Git is a version control that allows us to track changes made to our project. Using a Git repository, we can save versions of your code. 

  * Creating a repository is an important part of the development process and should be done each time you start a new project.

  * We can create a repository in two ways. We can clone an existing repository or initialize version control in a project created locally. This guide will walk you through both.
  
* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `21-Evr_Git-Guide/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Before we begin, it is important that we have changed our Git configuration so that the default branch is `main`. If you have not done so, please follow the installation instructions in the Guide and use `git config` to make that switch. If you have any issues, please reach out to a TA or stay for Office Hours so we can help. 

  ```bash
  git config --global init.defaultBranch main
  ```
* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:
  
  * 🔑 To use `git clone` to create a repo, we must first navigate to [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

  * We click in the `new` button to create a new repository. 

  * We give the repository the name `git-guide-sample` by adding it in the textbox under `Repository Name`.

  * 🔑 We click on the `Add a README file` checkbox.

  * We click `Create Repository` to create a repo. For now, our repo will only contain a README file.

  * On the repository page, we click on the green `Code` button and select the `HTTPS` option. Copy the value provided.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 In the terminal, we navigate to the Desktop folder. Then, we use `git clone` command plus the value copied to download the repo on to our local machine.

  ```bash
  git clone <url>
  ```

  * To navigate into our newly created repo, we use `cd` and the name of our repo.

  ```bash
  cd git-guide-sample
  ```

  * We use `touch` to add a new `index.html` file to our repo.

  ```bash
  touch index.html
  ```

  * We use `mkdir` to add a new directory in our repo.

  ```bash
  mkdir assets
  ```

  * To add a file to the directory, we use `cd` to navigate to the directory and `touch` to add a `style.css` file.

  ```bash
  cd assets
  touch style.css
  ```

  * To navigate back up into our main repo, we use `cd ..`

  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```

  * 🔑 To add our changes to staging, we use `git add .`

  ```bash
  git add .
  ```

  * 🔑 To commit our changes we use `git commit` and add a message describing the changes made.

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Message describing changes made" 
  ```

  * 🔑 To push our changes up our remote repo, we use `git push`. We add `origin` to designate the repo we just cloned and `main` because we are on the main branch.

  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * When we navigate back to the remote repo that we created, we see our changes have been added. Success!

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * Using `git clone` is one way to create a repo and download it for local use but you can also use `git init` to create a version control project locally. 

  * 🔑 We start by creating a new project locally using terminal commands. We use `cd` to navigate to the Desktop and `mkdir` to create a new directory called `git-init-sample`.

  ```bash
  cd Desktop
  mkdir git-init-sample
  ```
  * To add a file to our new project directory, we use `cd` to navigate into the directory and `touch` to add an `index.html`.

  ```bash
  cd git-init-sample
  touch index.html
  ```

  * 🔑 To initialize version control in  project, we use `git init`. It is important that we are in our project folder when we run this command!

  ```bash
  git init
  ```
  * 🔑 Using `git init` adds version control locally to a project, It doesn't create a remote repository.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * On [GitHub](https://github.com/), click on `new` to create a new repository.

  * Add a name for the repository, just like we did before.

  * 🔑 Do not click on any of the checkboxes or create a README. 

  * Click `Create Repository`.

  * Copy the code under under the header `"…or push an existing repository from the command line"`.

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * In your project directory, paste the commands copied from GitHub. This will sync your local repo with the repo you just created on GitHub.

* Open [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Our repo has been updated on GitHub. Success! 

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini Project (60 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

```md
@TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini Project  (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ @TODO { THIS }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

    ```
    @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
    ```

  * 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Homework (5 min)

* Open `02-Homework/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * During this week's homework, you will take an existing website and use the HTML and CSS skills practiced during this week to make sure the site is accessible using the provided guidelines.

  * Accessibility is an increasingly important consideration in web design. Inclusive design aims to make sure all users -- including those with disabilities -- are able to interact and understand a web page's content.

  * During activities this week, we had a brief introduction to the use of semantic HTML and accessibility concerns. This project will require you to dive a little deeper and do a bit of research to make sure the goal stated in the `user story` and each `acceptance criteria` is fully addressed. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 We are learning to build an website using HTML and CSs that is accessible to all users. 

  * ☝️ How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * 🙋 We will use our skills in HTML and CSS to refactor an existing webpage and build off of the accessibility concepts covered in class.

  * ☝️ How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * 🙋 As a developer, it is important to be able to design a website with all users in mind. 

* Ask TAs to direct students to the Homework Requirements found in `02-Homework/README.md`.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
