# 01.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to HTML and CSS

## Overview 

In today's class, students will be introduced to the fundamental technologies used to structure and style a webpage: HTML and CSS. Web accessability and the use of Semantic HTML is also addressed. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `05-Ins_HTML` through `14-Stu_CSS-Selectors`.

* When approaching today's activities, caution the students against rushing to write their solutions first. Instead, encourage students to use the provided `user stories` and `acceptance criteria` -- as introduced in the previous class -- to identify the user's goal and conditions that must be met for the solution to be accepted. This will help reinforce the computational thinking skills practiced during the first class and set them up for success for future coding challenges. 

* If students do not have the required tools installed or set-up on their local machines, refer them to Office Hours for assistance. A list of required tools and resources can be found in the [Lesson Plan for Day 1](../01-Day_Intro-Git/01.1-LESSON-PLAN.md) 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* @TODO Bullet the learning objectives for the lesson plan. Refer to your Activity Planner.

* @TODO When writing learning objectives, start each one with a measurable verb. Refer to this [list of measurable verbs used to assess learning outcomes](https://www.clinton.edu/curriculumcommittee/listofmeasurableverbs.cxml). For example, "Initialize projects and install third-party packages using npm."

* @TODO If a learning objective is a concept and not a demonstrable skill, use the verb "explain". For example, "Explain the client-server model."

* @TODO Do not use the verb "understand" because it is not measurable.

* @TODO Aim for 3&ndash;6 learning objectives. If you find yourself listing more than six, you may need to rethink the scope of your objectives or the lesson itself.

> **Important**: If this lesson occurs on a Saturday, make sure to adjust the activities to accommodate for the extra hour of class time. Feel free to take your time as you go through the activities; for example, you can add 5 minutes to the `Student Do` and `Instructor Review` sections as you see fit. Remember to take a 40-minute break at noon!

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Inform the students that during today's class they will take the first steps in web development by learning to use HTML and CSS to structure and style a webpage.

* Yet, before delving into the code, it is important to talk about one more important tool of communication: a `README` file. 

* Explain that as developers, we must be able to clearly communicate information in an easily conveyable format.

* One tool used by developers for this communication is a `README` file.

* Note that for each activity in this course, we use a `README` file to provide a `user story`, `acceptance criteria`, and information about the task to be completed. This makes the `README` file the first place you should look when starting an activity. 

* In addition, as developers we use a `README` file to provide information about our completed solution -- and the problem it solves -- to other developers.

* Stress that for each project in this course, you will be required to write a `README` that describes why you built the project, what problem it solves, and what you learned in developing a solution.

* Writing a `README` file is also a great way to explain how the the user goal identified in the `user story` and the `acceptance criteria` are clearly met by your solution.

* Open [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * While there is no one right way to write a `README`file, this template provides an excellent guide on the information typically conveyed in a project `README`. 

  * Note that this resource is available in this week's Homework folder. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use a `README` file to communicate with other developers? 

  * 🙋 A `README` file is used by developers to convey information. For example, each activity, a `README` file provides the information needed to complete our task. Project `README` files explain why the project was built, the problem solved and what was learned in the process.

* Transition to the next activity by reminding the students that each day's activities -- including the `README` file with information on how to complete the task -- is found in the class repository and should be downloaded by performing a `git pull` before class.  

### 2. Instructor Demo: HTML (5 min) 

* Open `04-Ins_Git/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure your page.

  * 🔑 HTML is made up of different elements that provide structure and content. 

  * 🔑 Some common HTML elements include section headings, images, paragraphs, unordered lists and links.

* Open `05-Ins_HTML/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We start every HTML documents with a document declaration. This lets the browser know that the content should be read as HTML. 

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```

  * We use an <HTML> tag to begin and end an HTML document. 

  * 🔑 The <head> element contains metadata. The content inside the <head> tags is not displayed on the page.

  ```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello HTML!</title>
  </head>
  ```

  * 🔑 The <body> element contains all the content visible on the page.

  * 🔑 Inside the <body> element, we define the different parts of a webpage using semantic elements such as <header> and <section>. Using semantic elements helps make our code easier to read and more accessible. 

  * 🔑 HTML also includes a number of elements used to display content such as text and images on the page. 

  * 🔑 Section heading elements are used for headings or sub-headings on your page. The <h1> is reserved for the title or most important heading, which the <h6> is the least important heading.

  ```html
   <h1>Hello World!</h1>
   <h2>Hello World!</h2>
   <h3>Hello World!</h3>
   <h4>Hello World!</h4>
   <h5>Hello World!</h5>
   <h6>Hello World!</h6>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an <img> element for images. 

  ```html
  <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="placeholder image"/>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use a paragraph <o> element to contain text.

  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an <ul> element to represent an unordered list of items.

  ```html
   <ul>
        <li>This is list item one</li>
        <li>This is list item two</li>
        <li>This is list item three</li>
      </ul>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an <a> tag to define a link.

  ```html
  <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google.com</a>
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }
