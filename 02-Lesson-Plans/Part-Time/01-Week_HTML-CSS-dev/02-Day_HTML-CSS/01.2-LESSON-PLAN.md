# 01.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to HTML and CSS

## Overview 

In today's class, students will be introduced to the fundamental technologies used to structure and style a webpage: HTML and CSS. Web accessability and the use of Semantic HTML is also addressed. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `05-Ins_HTML` through `14-Stu_CSS-Selectors`.

*  Learning HTML and CSS can be overwhelming, especially to learners who may have little prior coding experience. Remind students that Google is a great tool, used by beginners and experienced developers alike, to reinforce our classroom learning and look up HTML and CSS syntax as needed. 

* During activities, encourage students to use the provided `user stories` and `acceptance criteria` -- as introduced in the previous class -- to identify the user's goal and conditions that must be met for the solution to be accepted. This will help reinforce the computational thinking skills practiced during the first class and set them up for success for future coding challenges. 

* If students do not have the required tools installed or set-up on their local machines, refer them to Office Hours for assistance. A list of required tools and resources can be found in the [Lesson Plan for Day 1](../01-Day_Intro-Git/01.1-LESSON-PLAN.md) 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use HTML elements to add structure and content to a webpage

* Add attributes to configure or adjust behavior of specific elements

* @TODO If a learning objective is a concept and not a demonstrable skill, use the verb "explain". For example, "Explain the client-server model."

* @TODO Do not use the verb "understand" because it is not measurable.

* @TODO Aim for 3&ndash;6 learning objectives. If you find yourself listing more than six, you may need to rethink the scope of your objectives or the lesson itself.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Inform the students that during today's class they will take the first steps in web development by learning to use HTML and CSS to structure and style a webpage.

* Yet, before delving into the code, it is important to talk about one more important tool of communication: a `README` file. 

* Explain that as developers, we must be able to clearly communicate information in an easily conveyable format.

* One tool used by developers for this communication is a `README` file.

* Note that for each activity in this course, we use a `README` file to provide a `user story`, `acceptance criteria`, and information about the task to be completed. This makes the `README` file the first place you should look when starting an activity. 

* In addition, as developers we use a `README` file to provide information about our completed solution -- and the problem it solves -- to other developers.

* Stress that for each project in this course, you will be required to write a `README` that describes why you built the project, what problem it solves, and what you learned in developing a solution.

* Writing a `README` file is also a great way to convey how the the user goal identified in the `user story` and the `acceptance criteria` are clearly met by your solution.

* Open [Professional README Guide](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * While there is no one right way to write a `README`file, this template provides an excellent guide on the information typically conveyed in a project `README`. 

  * Note that this resource is available in this week's Homework folder. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use a `README` file to communicate with other developers? 

  * 🙋 A `README` file is used by developers to convey information. For example, each activity, a `README` file provides the information needed to complete our task. Project `README` files explain why the project was built, the problem solved and what was learned in the process.

* Transition to the next activity by reminding the students that each day's activities -- including the `README` file with information on how to complete the task -- is found in the class repository and should be downloaded by performing a `git pull` before class.  

### 2. Instructor Demo: HTML (5 min) 

* Open `05-Ins_HTML/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 HTML is a markup language that tells web browsers how to structure your page.

  * 🔑 HTML is made up of different elements that provide structure and content. 

  *  Some common HTML elements include section headings, images, paragraphs, unordered lists and links.

* Open `05-Ins_HTML/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We start every HTML documents with a document declaration. This lets the browser know that the content should be read as HTML. 

  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```

  * We use an `<HTML>` tag to begin and end an HTML document. 

  * 🔑 The `<head>` element contains metadata. The content inside the `<head>` tags is not displayed on the page.

  ```html
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Hello HTML!</title>
  </head>
  ```

  * 🔑 The `<body>` element contains all the content visible on the page.

  * 🔑 Inside the `<body>` element, we define the different parts of a webpage using semantic tags such as `<header>` and `<section>`. Using semantic elements helps make our code easier to read and more accessible. 

  * 🔑 HTML also includes a number of elements used to display content such as text and images on the page. 

  * 🔑 Section heading elements are used for headings or sub-headings on your page. The `<h1>` element is reserved for the main title or heading. The `<h6>` is used for the least important. 

  ```html
   <h1>Hello World!</h1>
   <h2>Hello World!</h2>
   <h3>Hello World!</h3>
   <h4>Hello World!</h4>
   <h5>Hello World!</h5>
   <h6>Hello World!</h6>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an `<img>` element for images. Inside the `<img>` tag, we specify a path to the image. 

  ```html
  <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="placeholder image"/>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use a paragraph `<p>` element to contain text.

  ```html
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
  ```

  * We use a `<strong>` tag to mark text that is important. Text inside the `<strong>` tag will be bolded.

  ```html
  <strong>BOLDED TEXT</strong>.
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an `<ul>` element to represent an unordered list of items.

  ```html
   <ul>
        <li>This is list item one</li>
        <li>This is list item two</li>
        <li>This is list item three</li>
      </ul>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an `<a>` tag to define a link. Inside the `<a>` tag, we must specify the link's destination.

  ```html
  <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google.com</a>
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we build a webpage using HTML elements?

  * 🙋 HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage. We use HTML elements to define the different parts and provide structure as well as visible content for the page. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_HTML/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: HTML (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_HTML/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# 🏗️ Create a Web Page Using HTML

## 💡 Hints

How can you use header tags to define the most important heading and the sub-headers? How will using different header tags impact the size of the text?

You can use a placeholder image from here: [Image](https://placehold.it/200x200)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the advantages of using semantic elements in your HTML? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

---

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: HTML (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with HTML? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `<body>`

  * ✔️ `<header>`

  * ✔️ `<h1>–<h6>`

  * ✔️ `<ul>`

  * ✔️ `<a>`

* Open `06-Stu_HTML/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We place all the visible content inside the `<body>` togs. 

  * 🔑 We use a semantic `<header>` tag to define the area of the website that is used as the header. While not visible on their own, semantic tags are key to making the structure of your webpage easily readable by the browser and accessible. 

  * 🔑 We use an `<h1>` tag to add the content of our main heading.

  ```html
   <header>
      <h1>Student Bio</h1>
    </header> 
  ```

  * We use the semantic tag <section> to define the two sections of our webpage.

  * We add an `<h2>` element in each section to provide a section heading. To make your page accessible, it is important not to skip a heading level. Since the main heading is `<h1>`, we use `<h2>` for our section headings.

  ```html
  <h2>Your Name</h2>
  ```

  * 🔑 We add an image to our Bio section using an `<img>` tag. The `src` is specifies the path to the image.

  ```html
   <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="Your Name">
   ```

  * 🔑 We add a paragraph of text to our webpage using a`<p>` tag.

  ```html
  <p>Write a short paragraph or two about yourself</p>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use an `<ul>` element to create an unordered list 
  
  ```html
  <ul>
        <li><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a></li>
        <li><strong>Github:</strong> <a href="#">sampleName</a></li>
        <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> <a href="#">coming soon</a></li>
      </ul>
  ```

  * 🔑 We add a link to our list items using an `<a>` tag. Inside the `<a>` tag, we specify the link's destination.

  ```html
  <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a>
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we add structure to our webpages?

  * 🙋 We use semantic elements to define different areas of our webpage.

  * ☝️ How do we add content to our webpages?

  * 🙋 We use HTML elements to add contents such as images, headings, and lists to the page. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on HTML Elements Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), [MDN Web Docs on HTML: A good basis for accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML) and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Attributes (5 min) 

* Open `07-Ins_Attributes/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We use attributes to configure or adjust behavior of specific elements.

  * Attributes are commonly used with link and image elements to provide important information.

  * We also use global attributes to identify elements for styling.

* Open `07-Ins_Attributes/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * We use an `src` attribute with an image element to specify the image's absolute or relative path.

  ```html
   <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="placeholder image"/>
   <img src="./assets/images/sample.jpg" alt="placeholder image"/>
  ```

  * Each image should also have an `alt` attribute. An `alt` attribute provides text that will be displayed if the image cannot be displayed. The `alt` attribute is also important to make your image accessible to users that may be unable to see the image or use assistive technologies to browse the web.

  ```html
   <img src="https://placehold.it/200x200" alt="placeholder image"/>
  ```

  * We use an `href` attribute  with an `<a>` element to specify the URL of the page we want to link to.

  ```html
  <a href="https://www.google.com">This is a link to Google.com</a>
  ```

  * We also use an `href` attribute with `<link>` element. This `<link>` element connects our HTML page to an external CSS stylesheet. The `href` specifies the relative path and the `rel` attribute describes the relationship. This is how we link our stylesheet to our HTML. 

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
  ```

  * Global attributes can be used on any element. We often use global attributes to identify an element and set-up our HTML elements for styling.

  * A `class` attribute is used to identify one or more elements.

  ```html
  <section class="section">
  ```

  * An `id` attribute is a unique identifier to identify a single element.

  ```html
  <p id="paragraph-1">Lorem ipsum, dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</p>
  ```

  * Once an element is identified using a global attribute and a `<link>` element is used with an `href` attribute that provides a path to a stylesheet, we can use CSS to style our page. We will be learning more about how to style HTML elements on our own in upcoming activities.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we add attributes to our HTML elements?

  * 🙋 We add attributes to our elements to provide additional information, identify the element, and to configure or adjust behavior of specific elements.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Attributes/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Attributes (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Attributes/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `class` attribute

  * ✔️  `id` attribute

  * ✔️  `href` attribute

  
* Open `08-Stu_Attributes/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * Adding global attributes to our HTML elements allows them to be styled with CSS.

* Open `08-Stu_Attributes/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use a global `class` attribute to add a `section` identifier to all sections.

  ```html
  <section class="section">
  ```

  * 🔑 We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the email list item.

  ```html
  <li id="email"><strong>Email:</strong> <a href="#">someplace@gmail.com</a></li>
  ```

  * We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the GitHub list item.

  ```html
  <li id="github"><strong>GitHub:</strong> <a href="#">sampleName</a></li>
  ```

  * We use a global `id` attribute to add a unique identifier to the Portfolio list item.

  ```html
  <li id="portfolio"><strong>Portfolio:</strong> <a href="#">coming soon</a></li>
  ```

  * 🔑 To link to our external stylesheet, we use a `<link>` element in the `<head>`. The `href` specifies the relative path. Without this link and `href` attribute pointing to the right path, our styles will not be displayed! 

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use global attributes to set up our HTML elements to connect with CSS?

  * 🙋 We use `class` and `id` attributes to identify elements we want to style.

  * ☝️ How do we use a `href` attribute with a <link> element to connect our CSS stylesheet?

  * 🙋 We use the `href` attribute to specify the relative path to the stylesheet. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on HTML Attribute Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Color (5 min) 

* Open `09-Ins-CSS-Color/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Color is a key tool used by web developers to add style and personality to webpages. We use CSS to add color to our webpages.

* Open `09-Ins-CSS-Color/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:
  
  * Before writing our CSS to add color to our page, we must first set-up our HTML. 

  * 🔑 To link our CSS stylesheet to our our HTML, we use a `<link>` element. The `href` must specify the relative path to the CSS file we want to use. The `rel` attribute defines the relationship. The `<link>` element is placed in the `<head>`.

  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css">
  ```

  *  We use `class` attributes to identify multiple elements for CSS styling. 

  ```html
  <section class="section box-orange">
  ```

  * We use `id` attributes to select a unique element for styling.

  ```html
  <section class="section" id="box-yellow">

* Open `09-Ins-CSS-Color/assets/style.css` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 A stylesheet is a list of CSS properties that defines how HTML elements will be displayed.

  * 🔑 Each rule block is made up of a selector indicating the element or elements you want to style and the CSS properties to be applied. When using `class` and `id` attributes, the name of the selector will match the name of the attribute. For classes, a `.` precedes the name. For an id, a `#` is used. 

  ```css
  .section {
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 To apply color to our pages, we use the `color` property to change the text color. We use the  `background-color` property to add color to the entire width and height of the element.

  ```css
  .box-blue {
  color: white; 
  background-color: #0000ff;
  }
  ```

  * We can specify colors we want displayed a number of different ways. 

  * 🔑 We use predefined colors to define the colors by name.

  ```css
  #box-yellow {
  color: purple;
  background-color: yellow;
  };
  ```
  
  * 🔑 We can also hexadecimal codes. This allows us to be more specific in our color choice.

  ```css
  .box-orange {
  color: #0000ff;
  background-color: #ffa500;
  }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we use CSS to add color to our webpages?

  * 🙋 We use CSS properties `color` and `background-color` to assign the colors we want applied to our elements. We define the colors using predefined colors or hex codes. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_CSS-Color/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 min)
