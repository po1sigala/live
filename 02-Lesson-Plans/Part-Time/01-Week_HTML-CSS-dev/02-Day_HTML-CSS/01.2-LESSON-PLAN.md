# XX.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to HTML and CSS

## Overview 

In today's class, students will be introduced to the fundamental technologies used to structure and style a webpage: HTML and CSS. Web accessability and the use of Semantic HTML is also addressed. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `05-Ins_HTML` through `14-Stu_CSS-Selectors`.

* When approaching today's activities, caution the students against rushing to write their solutions first. Instead, encourage students to use the provided `user stories` and `acceptance criteria` to identify the user's goal and conditions that must be met for the solution to be accepted. This will help reinforce the computational thinking skills practiced during the first class and set them up for success for future coding challenges. 

* If students do not have the required tools installed or set-up on their local machines, refer them to Office Hours for assistance. A list of required tools and resources can be found in the [Lesson Plan for Day 1](../01-Day_Intro-Git/01.1-LESSON-PLAN.md) 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* @TODO Bullet the learning objectives for the lesson plan. Refer to your Activity Planner.

* @TODO When writing learning objectives, start each one with a measurable verb. Refer to this [list of measurable verbs used to assess learning outcomes](https://www.clinton.edu/curriculumcommittee/listofmeasurableverbs.cxml). For example, "Initialize projects and install third-party packages using npm."

* @TODO If a learning objective is a concept and not a demonstrable skill, use the verb "explain". For example, "Explain the client-server model."

* @TODO Do not use the verb "understand" because it is not measurable.

* @TODO Aim for 3&ndash;6 learning objectives. If you find yourself listing more than six, you may need to rethink the scope of your objectives or the lesson itself.

> **Important**: If this lesson occurs on a Saturday, make sure to adjust the activities to accommodate for the extra hour of class time. Feel free to take your time as you go through the activities; for example, you can add 5 minutes to the `Student Do` and `Instructor Review` sections as you see fit. Remember to take a 40-minute break at noon!
