### 1. Instructor Do: Introduction to IndexedDB (10 min)
​
* Welcome students to class.
​
How do we store data client-side? 
​
What are some of the issues we encounter storing data client-side? 
​
 String value pairs; objects must be stringified and strings must be converted to JSON.
​
 Size limits
​
Open Application tab and explain the following: 
​
 In addition to Local Storage and Session Storage, we have two more options: Cookies and IndexedDB.
​
What is a cookie? 
​
 An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with the next request to the same server. Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser — keeping a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
​
 According to MDN: _Cookies were once used for general client-side storage. While this was legitimate when they were the only way to store data on the client, it is recommended nowadays to prefer modern storage APIs. Cookies are sent with every request, so they can worsen performance (especially for mobile data connections). Modern APIs for client storage are the Web storage API (localStorage and sessionStorage) and IndexedDB._
​
​
 If we want to learn more, we can read the [MDN documentation for cookies]https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies
​
What is IndexedDB? 
​
 From the name, IndexedDB, we can guess that it is a database (DB) accessed by Index in the client! Like MongoDB, it is object-oriented, meaning we can store anything in it!
​
 MDN: _IndexedDB is a transactional database system, like an SQL-based RDBMS. However, unlike SQL-based RDBMSes, which use fixed-column tables, IndexedDB is a JavaScript-based object-oriented database. IndexedDB lets you store and retrieve objects that are indexed with a key; any objects supported by the structured clone algorithm can be stored. You need to specify the database schema, open a connection to your database, and then retrieve and update data within a series of transactions._
​
Why IndexedDB? 
​
 Large amounts of data, offline experience, improved performance.
​
@TODO THIS IS THE OUTLINE FOR THE LP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
​
Basic pattern 
​
1. Open a database.
2. Create an object store in the database. 
3. Start a transaction and make a request to do some database operation, like adding or retrieving data.
4. Wait for the operation to complete by listening to the right kind of DOM event.
5. Do something with the results (which can be found on the request object).

​
Also needs to address these concepts: 
Database
Object store
Index
Operation
Transactoin
Cursor
​
### 2. Instructor Do: Opening a Database (5 min)
​
* key point(s): 
​
 * We access `indexedDB` via the `window` object
​
 * We create a new IndexedDB using the `open` method and pass it a name for the DB and a version number
​
Open [](@TODO)
​
```js
  const request = window.indexedDB.open("MyFirstDatabase", 1);
```
​
Open Application in DevTools 
​
* Ask
​
 * version number?
​
 * 
​
​
### Students Do: My First IndexedDB
​
```md
@TODO
​
## Bonus
​
IndexedDB is a very new API and is not supported in older browsers. How would we check if a user has IndexedDB?
```
​
### Instructor Do: My First IndexedDB Review
​
​
​
​
​
### Instructor Do: Create an Object Store Demo 
​
​
​
​
​
​
### Add Objects to the Store with Transactions
​
Transactions have three available modes: readonly, readwrite, and versionchange.
​
### Getting Objects from the Store 
​
Indexes
Cursors
