# XX.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Constructors üë∑üèΩ

## Instructors and TAs: Please take the Mid-Course Instructional Staff Survey

Trilogy as a company values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It‚Äôs hard for us to know what these areas are unless we‚Äôre asking questions. Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are vital members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we would appreciate your feedback at the following link:
[https://forms.gle/yPfrY4CjNeAqbVKD6](https://forms.gle/yPfrY4CjNeAqbVKD6)

## Overview 

In this class we will be covering some very important topics regarding object oriented programming. This includes constructor functions that allow us to dynamically create objects from a blueprint or schema. Additionally, we will cover prototypes, polymorphism and promises. Some of these sound scarier than they actually are, however it is important to approach these concepts with a growth mindset. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors` through `10-Student-Promises-2`

* The concepts we will cover today are things we, as developers, use on a daily basis. Teaching these concepts is another task however. Be prepared for answering student questions by reviewing some examples of the following topics:
  * Constructors
  * Prototypes
  * Polymorphism
  * Promises

* Constructors are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications. Make sure your students have a firm understanding of how objects function. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought." Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use object oriented programming to create a banking application.

* Use constructor functions to create new objects.

* Use prototypical inheritance to add methods to objects.

* Use and recognize polymorphism in our code.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k9lO6jSIGGYNRDKULu6O1glKQzyvaPTIkRSRnIWbbqg/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Constructors (Title)**: Today will be an introduction to OOP, more specifically objects and constructors.

  *  **What is programming?**: So what exactly is programming?

  *  **Programming**: The designing and building of an executable program that will accomplish a specific computing task. Essentially, programming is problem solving.

  *  **What problems do we solve?**: What problems do programmers solve?

  * **Algorithms and Automation**: Programming allows for us to solve almost any task or problem on a computer. There are two primary categories: Algorithms and Automation.

  * **What is DRY?**: What does DRY mean?

  * **DRY**: Dry means ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Repeat Yourself!‚Äù. Rewriting code wastes time, memory, and can confuse later readers and/or contributors to your code.

  * **What is an object?**: What is an object?

  * **Objects**: Objects in JavaScript are unordered collections of related data built on a key:value structure where values can be any data-type, including functions. 

  * **Why are Objects important in Javascript**: What makes objects so important?

  * **Everything is an object!**: Well, almost everything. Arrays, Date, Math, even functions are objects! Primitive types are NOT objects.

  * **What is object-oriented programming?**: What is OOP?

  * **OOP**: OOP is a programming paradigm or pattern of programming centered around objects. Problems are thought of in a way in which a collection of objects work together to solve a problem.


* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/28-Mini-Project/README.md` in your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * In this assignment we are going to take what we have learned with object oriented programming and build a Word Guess command-line game.

  * This is a fun way for us to use classes in conjunction with inquirer and Node to demonstrate our skills

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning Object Oriented programming and how to use ES6 classes or constructor functions to build a command line app

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã This will build upon our knowledge of Node and newer ES6 syntax

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Building an app like this is an exercise in building application using javascript outside of the browser. This is the fundamental characteristic of back end development, and we are just starting to scratch the surface.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Cats and Dogs (5 min) 

* Open [rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/01-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors/rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js) in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë When we run the program, we see some output in the terminal

  * üîë In this application we first made an Animal constructor which we then use to create instances, "cat" and "dog" from.
  
    * These instances in turn inherit the three keys from the constructor: "raining", "noise", and "makeNoise". 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We could build our own objects with those three keys, "raining", "noise", and "makeNoise" for starters.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [].

### 3. Student Do: Cats and Dogs (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [02-Stu-Cats-And-Dogs](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/02-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Cats and Dogs

In this activity you will make a cat object and dog object each with three keys.

## Instructions

* Make a dogs object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of true

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

* Next make a cats object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of false

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark

* Make the cat meow

## üèÜBONUS 

* Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.

* See if there is anyway to further optimize your code.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Cats and Dogs (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this exercise in creating objects? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è This assignment was meant to show you that it is possible to have the "value" portion of a "key/value" pair equal a function.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è That is a big different from what you have seen in most objects. Usually we see something like `color: "blue"`, but here we would see something like: `sayColor: () => console.log("blue")`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Dot notation can be used to modify object and call methods

* Open [02-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/02-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs/Solved/rainingCatsAndDogs-noCon.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We create a `makeNoise` key and give it the value of a function.

  ```js
  makeNoise: function() {
    if (this.raining === true) {
      console.log(this.noise);
      }
    }
  };
  ```

  * üîë We use dot notation to call methods contained in our object.

  ```js
  dogs.makeNoise();
  ```

  * üîë We can change the value of a key using dot notation as well.

  ```js
  cats.raining = true;
  ```

  * We create a function `massHysteria` which take the dog and cat object and check to see if they both have a key/value pair of `raining: true`.

  ```js
  const massHysteria = function(dogs, cats) {
  if (dogs.raining === true && cats.raining === true) {
    console.log("DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!");
    }
  };
  ```

  * Finally we invoke our function by passing in our two objects.

  ```js
  massHysteria(dogs, cats);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What if we wanted to create multiple different animal objects from a blueprint?

  * üôã We can use a constructor function to create objects based on a structure we specify.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Prototypes (5 min) 

* Open [03-Ins_Prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/03-Ins_Prototypes/prototype-demo.js) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node prototype-demo` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * We create an array, and console log it. Next, we call the `.forEach` and `.map` methods on it.

  ```js
  myArray = [2, 4, 6, 8];
  console.log(myArray);

  myArray.forEach((num) => console.log(num));

  myArray.map((x) => console.log(x * 2));
  ```
  
  * üîë Next we console log the string `Hello`. We then call `"Hello.toLowerCase"`

  ```js

  console.log("Hello");
  console.log("Hello".toLowerCase());

  console.log(1337);
  console.log((1337).toString());
  ```

  * We created a constructor function named `Movie`, which will take in two arguments, `title` and `releaseYear`.

  ```js
  function Movie(title, releaseYear) {
    this.title = title;
    this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
  }
  ```

  * üîë A few things to keep in mind about what we see here:
    * Objects, arrays, and primitives all have a `.prototype.`
    * The `.prototype.` has methods and properties attached to it.
    * Prototype methods are declared once in memory, but all instances have access to them
    * Instance methods only exist on that instance, while prototype methods exist on all instances

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where did the `.toLowerCase` come from?

  * üôã While those two methods did not show up when we console logged our string, the prototype has these methods built in. Arrays, Objects, even primitives all have a prototype which they take their structure and methods from. Any of of these that you create will have the prototype methods available to it via the `.prototype.`. i.e., `Array.prototype.forEach()`

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [04-Stu_RPG_Prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_RPG-Prototypes/README.md).

### 6. Student Do: RPG Prototypes (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [04-Stu_RPG_Prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_RPG-Prototypes/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Character Creation with Prototypes

In this activity you will generate RPG characters using Objects and prototypes.

## Instructions

* Over the course of this activity you are going to be using constructors to create simplistic characters for use within a very basic Roleplaying Game (RPG)

* Each character created using your constructor should have the following properties...

  * Name: The character's name --> String

  * Profession: What the character does for a living --> String

  * Age: The character's age --> Number

  * Strength: Abstraction for how strong the character is --> Number

  * HitPoints (HP): Abstraction for how much health the character has --> Number

  * PrintStats: Function which prints all of a character's properties to the screen

  * Once you have created your constructor, create two new characters and print their properties to the screen

* Now add 3 methods onto it via the prototype.

  * IsAlive: Function which prints whether or not this character is alive by looking into their HP and determining whether they are above or below zero.

  * Attack: Function which takes in a second character and subtracts this character's strength from their HP.

  * LevelUp: Function which increases this character's Age by 1, their Strength by 5, and their HP by 25.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: RPG Prototypes (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with prototypes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è In this activity we set up a constructor function for a character

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We use the `this` keyword which refers to the instance of the object. Another way to think of the this keyword is "referring to the nearest object instance that is being declared"


* Open [rpg-prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_RPG-Prototypes/Solved/rpg-prototypes.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We create a `Character` constructor that will take in 6 arguments. We assign those arguments to keys in our constructor.

  ```js
  function Character(name, profession, gender, age, strength, hitpoints) {
    this.name = name;
    this.profession = profession;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.age = age;
    this.strength = strength;
    this.hitpoints = hitpoints;
  }
  ```

  * We add an `isAlive` function to our object prototype.

  ```js
  Character.prototype.isAlive = function() {
	if (this.hitpoints > 0) {
		console.log(this.name + " is still alive!");
		console.log("\n-------------\n");
		return true;
	}
    console.log(this.name + " has died!");
    return false;
  };
  ```

  * We also add two other functions to our `prototype`. The `attack` method takes in a second object and decreases their "hitpoints" by this character's strength. The `levelUp` method increases `this` character's stats when called.

  ```js
  Character.prototype.attack = function(character2) {
    character2.hitpoints -= this.strength;
  };

  Character.prototype.levelUp = function() {
    this.age += 1;
    this.strength += 5;
    this.hitpoints += 25;
  };
  ```

  * üîë Finally we can use our constructor to create two characters, calling their methods from the prototype that we added.


  ```js
  var warrior = new Character("Crusher", "Warrior", "Male", 25, 10, 75);
  var rogue = new Character("Dodger", "Rogue", "Female", 23, 20, 50);

  warrior.printStats();
  rogue.printStats();

  rogue.attack(warrior);
  warrior.printStats();
  warrior.isAlive();

  rogue.levelUp();
  rogue.printStats();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why don't we just declare the methods in the constructor?

  * üôã When we bind a function using the `this` keyword, the method only exists on that instance of the object. For any method bound to `this`, it will be re declared with each new instance of an object.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does the prototype help us solve this problem?

  * üôã The prototype allows us to declare methods that will be attached to all instances of an object of that prototype. Because the method is applied to the prototype, it is only stored in memory once for all instances.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes) and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
