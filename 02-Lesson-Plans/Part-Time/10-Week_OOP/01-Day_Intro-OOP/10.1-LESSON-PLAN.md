Trilogy as a company values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It‚Äôs hard for us to know what these areas are unless we‚Äôre asking questions. Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are vital members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans
we would appreciate your feedback at the following link:

## Overview

In this class we will be introducing students to the usage of JavaScript constructors and how they can be used to dynamically create objects with similar schemas.

`Summary: Complete activities 1-7 in Unit 10`

## Instructor's Notes

* Constructors are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications. Make sure your students have a firm understanding of how objects function.

* At the beginning of this class, make sure to go over the basics of objects once again so as to help your students recall how they are created and used. This will ultimately help them in understanding constructors better.

## Learning Objectives

* By the end of class students will be able to...

  * Use OOP to create a banking application.

  * Use constructor functions to create new objects.

  * Use object prototypes to add methods to objects.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 mins)

* Welcome your students to class and tell them that today we will be revisiting objects and building upon our past knowledge of them to create more dynamic object-oriented applications.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is an object?

  * üôã Objects are a data structure allowing for us to store properties and methods in a `key:value` pairing.

* Navigate to [07-Stu_Tamagotchi](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/07-Tamagotchi/Solved/tamagotchi-this.js) and open it in your terminal.

* Enter the command `node tamagotchi-this dog letInside` in your terminal and show students the output.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What would we need to know to make this application with objects?

  * üôã By the end of the class we will know everything necessary to create this CLI Application.

### 2. Students Do: Raining Cats and Dogs (10 mins)

* Direct students to the first activity, found in [01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs)

```md
# Cats and Dogs

In this activity you will make a cat object and dog object each with three keys.

## Instructions

* Make a dogs object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of true

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

* Next make a cats object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of false

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark

* Make the cat meow

## üèÜBONUS

* Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.

* See if there is anyway to further optimize your code.
```

### 3. Instructor Do: Review Raining Cats and Dogs (10 mins)

* Open [01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs Solved/script.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs/Solved) in your IDE and point out the following points to students:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We create a `makeNoise` key and give it the value of a function.

  ```js
  makeNoise: function() {
    if (this.raining === true) {
      console.log(this.noise);
      }
    }
  };
  ```

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We use dot notation to call methods contained in our object.

  ```js
  dogs.makeNoise();
  ```

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We can change the value of a key using dot notation as well.

  ```js
  cats.raining = true;
  ```
  
  * ‚úîÔ∏è We create a function `massHysteria` which will take in a dogs object and cats object and check that BOTH have a key:value of `raining: true`. 

  ```js
  const massHysteria = function(dogs, cats) {
  if (dogs.raining === true && cats.raining === true) {
    console.log("DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!");
    }
  };
  ```

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Finally we invoke our function passing in our two objects.

  ```js
  massHysteria(dogs, cats);
  ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What if we wanted to create multiple different animal objects from a blueprint?

  * üôã We can use a constructor function to create objects based on a structure we specify.

  * Use the discussion to transition to the next topic.

### Instructor Do: Cats and Dogs with Constructors! (10 min)

* Navigate to [02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors/rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js) and open it in your IDE.

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What difference do you from the previous activity we worked on?

  * üôã We create a constructor function called `Animals`, instead of individual cat and dog objects.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is `Animal` upper-cased. Ô∏è

  * üôã It is a common naming convention to upper-case the names of constructor functions, as well as classes.

* With [02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/02-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors/rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js) open in your IDE, point out the following to students:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We first declare a constructor function named `Animal`. It will take 2 parameters which will be passed into our keys as their value.

  ```js
  function Animal(raining, noise) {
    this.raining = raining;
    this.noise = noise;
  ```

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We give our object a key of `makeNoise` thats value is a function. The function checks if the `raining` key's value is `true`, and if it is `console.log` the value of the key `noise`.

  ```js
  this.makeNoise = function() {
    if (this.raining === true) {
      console.log(this.noise);
    }
  };
  ```
