# XX.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Constructors üë∑üèΩ

## Instructors and TAs: Please take the Mid-Course Instructional Staff Survey

Trilogy as a company values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It‚Äôs hard for us to know what these areas are unless we‚Äôre asking questions. Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are vital members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we would appreciate your feedback at the following link:

## Overview 

In this class we will be covering some very important topics regarding object oriented programming. This includes constructor functions that allow us to dynamically create objects from a blueprint or schema. Additionally, we will cover prototypes, polymorphism and promises. Some of these sound scarier than they actually are, however it is important to approach these concepts with a growth mindset. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors` through `10-Student-Promises-2`

* The concepts we will cover today are things we, as developers, use on a daily basis. Teaching these concepts is another task however. Be prepared for answering student questions by reviewing some examples of the following topics:
  * Constructors
  * Prototypes
  * Polymorphism
  * Promises

* Constructors are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications. Make sure your students have a firm understanding of how objects function. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought." Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use object oriented programming to create a banking application.

* Use constructor functions to create new objects.

* Use prototypical inheritance to add methods to objects.

* Use and recognize polymorphism in our code.
