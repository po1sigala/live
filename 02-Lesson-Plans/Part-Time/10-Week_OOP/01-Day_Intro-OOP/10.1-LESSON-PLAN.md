# XX.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Constructors üë∑üèΩ

## Instructors and TAs: Please take the Mid-Course Instructional Staff Survey

Trilogy as a company values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It‚Äôs hard for us to know what these areas are unless we‚Äôre asking questions. Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are vital members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans, we would appreciate your feedback at the following link:
[https://forms.gle/yPfrY4CjNeAqbVKD6](https://forms.gle/yPfrY4CjNeAqbVKD6)

## Overview 

In this class we will be covering some very important topics regarding object oriented programming. This includes constructor functions that allow us to dynamically create objects from a blueprint or schema. Additionally, we will cover prototypes, polymorphism and promises. Some of these sound scarier than they actually are, however it is important to approach these concepts with a growth mindset. 

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors` through `10-Student-Promises-2`

* The concepts we will cover today are things we, as developers, use on a daily basis. Teaching these concepts is another task however. Be prepared for answering student questions by reviewing some examples of the following topics:
  * Constructors
  * Prototypes
  * Polymorphism
  * Promises

* Constructors are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications. Make sure your students have a firm understanding of how objects function. 

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought." Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Use object oriented programming to create a banking application.

* Use constructor functions to create new objects.

* Use prototypical inheritance to add methods to objects.

* Use and recognize polymorphism in our code.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k9lO6jSIGGYNRDKULu6O1glKQzyvaPTIkRSRnIWbbqg/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Constructors (Title)**: Today will be an introduction to OOP, more specifically objects and constructors.

  *  **What is programming?**: So what exactly is programming?

  *  **Programming**: The designing and building of an executable program that will accomplish a specific computing task. Essentially, programming is problem solving.

  *  **What problems do we solve?**: What problems do programmers solve?

  * **Algorithms and Automation**: Programming allows for us to solve almost any task or problem on a computer. There are two primary categories: Algorithms and Automation.

  * **What is DRY?**: What does DRY mean?

  * **DRY**: Dry means ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Repeat Yourself!‚Äù. Rewriting code wastes time, memory, and can confuse later readers and/or contributors to your code.

  * **What is an object?**: What is an object?

  * **Objects**: Objects in JavaScript are unordered collections of related data built on a key:value structure where values can be any data-type, including functions. 

  * **Why are Objects important in Javascript**: What makes objects so important?

  * **Everything is an object!**: Well, almost everything. Arrays, Date, Math, even functions are objects! Primitive types are NOT objects.

  * **What is object-oriented programming?**: What is OOP?

  * **OOP**: OOP is a programming paradigm or pattern of programming centered around objects. Problems are thought of in a way in which a collection of objects work together to solve a problem.


* Navigate to `01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/28-Mini-Project/README.md` in your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * In this assignment we are going to take what we have learned with object oriented programming and build a Word Guess command-line game.

  * This is a fun way for us to use classes in conjunction with inquirer and Node to demonstrate our skills

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning Object Oriented programming and how to use ES6 classes or constructor functions to build a command line app

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã This will build upon our knowledge of Node and newer ES6 syntax

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Building an app like this is an exercise in building application using javascript outside of the browser. This is the fundamental characteristic of back end development, and we are just starting to scratch the surface.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Cats and Dogs (5 min) 

* Open [rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/01-Ins_Cats-And-Dogs-Constructors/rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js) in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node rainingCatsAndDogs-con.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë When we run the program, we see some output in the terminal

  * üîë In this application we first made an Animal constructor which we then use to create instances, "cat" and "dog" from.
  
    * These instances in turn inherit the three keys from the constructor: "raining", "noise", and "makeNoise". 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We could build our own objects with those three keys, "raining", "noise", and "makeNoise" for starters.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [].

### 3. Student Do: Cats and Dogs (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [02-Stu-Cats-And-Dogs](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/02-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Cats and Dogs

In this activity you will make a cat object and dog object each with three keys.

## Instructions

* Make a dogs object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of true

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

* Next make a cats object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of false

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark

* Make the cat meow

## üèÜBONUS 

* Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.

* See if there is anyway to further optimize your code.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Cats and Dogs (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this exercise in creating objects? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è This assignment was meant to show you that it is possible to have the "value" portion of a "key/value" pair equal a function.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è That is a big different from what you have seen in most objects. Usually we see something like `color: "blue"`, but here we would see something like: `sayColor: () => console.log("blue")`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Dot notation can be used to modify object and call methods

* Open [02-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/02-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs/Solved/rainingCatsAndDogs-noCon.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We create a `makeNoise` key and give it the value of a function.

  ```js
  makeNoise: function() {
    if (this.raining === true) {
      console.log(this.noise);
      }
    }
  };
  ```

  * üîë We use dot notation to call methods contained in our object.

  ```js
  dogs.makeNoise();
  ```

  * üîë We can change the value of a key using dot notation as well.

  ```js
  cats.raining = true;
  ```

  * We create a function `massHysteria` which take the dog and cat object and check to see if they both have a key/value pair of `raining: true`.

  ```js
  const massHysteria = function(dogs, cats) {
  if (dogs.raining === true && cats.raining === true) {
    console.log("DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!");
    }
  };
  ```

  * Finally we invoke our function by passing in our two objects.

  ```js
  massHysteria(dogs, cats);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What if we wanted to create multiple different animal objects from a blueprint?

  * üôã We can use a constructor function to create objects based on a structure we specify.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Prototypes (5 min) 

* Open [03-Ins_Prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/03-Ins_Prototypes/prototype-demo.js) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node prototype-demo` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * We create an array, and console log it. Next, we call the `.forEach` and `.map` methods on it.

  ```js
  myArray = [2, 4, 6, 8];
  console.log(myArray);

  myArray.forEach((num) => console.log(num));

  myArray.map((x) => console.log(x * 2));
  ```
  
  * üîë Next we console log the string `Hello`. We then call `"Hello.toLowerCase"`

  ```js

  console.log("Hello");
  console.log("Hello".toLowerCase());

  console.log(1337);
  console.log((1337).toString());
  ```

  * We created a constructor function named `Movie`, which will take in two arguments, `title` and `releaseYear`.

  ```js
  function Movie(title, releaseYear) {
    this.title = title;
    this.releaseYear = releaseYear;
  }
  ```

  * üîë A few things to keep in mind about what we see here:
    * Objects, arrays, and primitives all have a `.prototype.`
    * The `.prototype.` has methods and properties attached to it.
    * Prototype methods are declared once in memory, but all instances have access to them
    * Instance methods only exist on that instance, while prototype methods exist on all instances

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where did the `.toLowerCase` come from?

  * üôã While those two methods did not show up when we console logged our string, the prototype has these methods built in. Arrays, Objects, even primitives all have a prototype which they take their structure and methods from. Any of of these that you create will have the prototype methods available to it via the `.prototype.`. i.e., `Array.prototype.forEach()`

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [04-Stu_RPG_Prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_RPG-Prototypes/README.md).

### 6. Student Do: RPG Prototypes (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [04-Stu_RPG_Prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_RPG-Prototypes/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Character Creation with Prototypes

In this activity you will generate RPG characters using Objects and prototypes.

## Instructions

* Over the course of this activity you are going to be using constructors to create simplistic characters for use within a very basic Roleplaying Game (RPG)

* Each character created using your constructor should have the following properties...

  * Name: The character's name --> String

  * Profession: What the character does for a living --> String

  * Age: The character's age --> Number

  * Strength: Abstraction for how strong the character is --> Number

  * HitPoints (HP): Abstraction for how much health the character has --> Number

  * PrintStats: Function which prints all of a character's properties to the screen

  * Once you have created your constructor, create two new characters and print their properties to the screen

* Now add 3 methods onto it via the prototype.

  * IsAlive: Function which prints whether or not this character is alive by looking into their HP and determining whether they are above or below zero.

  * Attack: Function which takes in a second character and subtracts this character's strength from their HP.

  * LevelUp: Function which increases this character's Age by 1, their Strength by 5, and their HP by 25.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 7. Instructor Review: RPG Prototypes (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with prototypes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è In this activity we set up a constructor function for a character

  * ‚úîÔ∏è We use the `this` keyword which refers to the instance of the object. Another way to think of the this keyword is "referring to the nearest object instance that is being declared"


* Open [rpg-prototypes](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/04-Stu_RPG-Prototypes/Solved/rpg-prototypes.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We create a `Character` constructor that will take in 6 arguments. We assign those arguments to keys in our constructor.

  ```js
  function Character(name, profession, gender, age, strength, hitpoints) {
    this.name = name;
    this.profession = profession;
    this.gender = gender;
    this.age = age;
    this.strength = strength;
    this.hitpoints = hitpoints;
  }
  ```

  * We add an `isAlive` function to our object prototype.

  ```js
  Character.prototype.isAlive = function() {
	if (this.hitpoints > 0) {
		console.log(this.name + " is still alive!");
		console.log("\n-------------\n");
		return true;
	}
    console.log(this.name + " has died!");
    return false;
  };
  ```

  * We also add two other functions to our `prototype`. The `attack` method takes in a second object and decreases their "hitpoints" by this character's strength. The `levelUp` method increases `this` character's stats when called.

  ```js
  Character.prototype.attack = function(character2) {
    character2.hitpoints -= this.strength;
  };

  Character.prototype.levelUp = function() {
    this.age += 1;
    this.strength += 5;
    this.hitpoints += 25;
  };
  ```

  * üîë Finally we can use our constructor to create two characters, calling their methods from the prototype that we added.


  ```js
  var warrior = new Character("Crusher", "Warrior", "Male", 25, 10, 75);
  var rogue = new Character("Dodger", "Rogue", "Female", 23, 20, 50);

  warrior.printStats();
  rogue.printStats();

  rogue.attack(warrior);
  warrior.printStats();
  warrior.isAlive();

  rogue.levelUp();
  rogue.printStats();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why don't we just declare the methods in the constructor?

  * üôã When we bind a function using the `this` keyword, the method only exists on that instance of the object. For any method bound to `this`, it will be re declared with each new instance of an object.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does the prototype help us solve this problem?

  * üôã The prototype allows us to declare methods that will be attached to all instances of an object of that prototype. Because the method is applied to the prototype, it is only stored in memory once for all instances.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes) and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 min) // 05-Ins-Polymorphism

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open [05-Ins-Polymorphism](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/05-Ins-Polymorphism/index.js) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë When we run this file, we notice some output in the terminal

  * üîë If you we look at our code, we notice that our instance `macbook` is able to call getInfo despite the fact that the method isn't created inside it's own class

  ```js
  class Computer {
    constructor(type) {
      this.type = type;
    }

    getInfo() {
      return `This computer is a ${this.type}`;
    }
  }

  const macbook = new Laptop('mac', 'macbook pro');
  macbook.getInfo() // Outputs: 'This computer is a macbook'
  ```
  * This is made possible by the concept of Polymorphism. In OOP, it is the ability to create a variable, a function, or an object that has more than one form. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We would create a parent class called Computer and then create another subclass called Laptop that extends Computer.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [06-Stu-Polymorphism].

### 9. Student Do: Developer Polymorphism (15 min) // 06-Stu-Polymorphism 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Implement Object Instances with Polymorphism

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to use *polymorphism* to create objects that have mostly similar functionality

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when the app creates multiple subclasses that extend "Developer".
  * Each should have that have the ability to inherit a `sayHi` method from the parent
  * It's done when I have creating derivative objects from a parent object that have one unique method of their own

  ## üí° Hints

  * Look up the `extends` keyword to see how you can inherit methods from a parent class

  * The `super` method calls to the parent class's constructor allowing you to access variables and methods
    
  * Derivative objects can add additional functionality


  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Add another method outside of the class using the prototype

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Developer Polymorphism (10 min) // 06-Ins-Polymorphism 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with this idea of polymorphism? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è This exercise was meant to demonstrate Polymorphism and the ability to create a variable, a function, or an object that has more than one form.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è In DRY programming, it is beneficial to have a way to write an object or class once, and tweak it for more refined definitions. For example, most cars are the same, but not all use a combustion engine. We could create a parent class Car to handle most cars and then extend that class to override or add methods specific to a subclass, Electric cars.

* Open [06-Stu-Polymorphism](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/06-Stu-Polymorhphism/Solved/index.js) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * First we create our parent class, Developer, and the method to `sayHi`

    ```js
    class Developer {
      constructor(name) {
        this.developerName = name;
      }

      sayHi() {
        return `Hey! my name is ${this.developerName} üëã`;
      }
    }
    ```
  * The constructor function allows us to build objects by calling the `new` keyword in our variable definition. The `sayHi` method will be inherited by any instance of the developer class.

  * Next, we create a class that `extends` Developer called `Frontend`. We also add our own custom method for instances of `Frontend` called `saySkill`. This method will simply return a statement about the tech stack the developer is using.

  ```js
  class FrontEnd extends Developer {
    constructor(name, stack) {
      super(name);
      this.techStack = stack;
    }

    saySkill() {
      return `${this.sayHi()}, I code with ${this.techStack}`;
    }
  }
  ```

  * Finally, we create another class called `Backend` which also extends `Developer`. This class has its own custom method called `code` which writes out a snippet of code that the developer might write.

  ```js
  class Backend extends Developer {
    constructor(name, snippet) {
      super(name);
      this.snippet = snippet;
    }

    code() {
      return `${this.sayHi()}, I would run something like ${this.snippet}`;
    }
  }
  ```

  * üîë It is important to note that instances of Frontend or Backend would still inherit the ability to `sayHi`, as they are extended from the parent class `Developer`

  ```js
  const frontend = new FrontEnd('Kyle', 'Typescript');
  const backend = new Backend('Kelly', 'SELECT * FROM users;');

  console.log(frontEnd.sayHi()); // Hey! my name is Kyle üëã`
  console.log(backEnd.sayHi()); // Hey! my name is Kelly üëã
  ```

  * üîë Notice that both the `Frontend` and `Backend` classes have their own custom methods that do not exist on `Developer`. This comes back to the concept of polymorphism where you can create derivate objects from a parent object or class

  ```js
  console.log(frontEnd.saySkill()); 
  // OUTPUTS: Hey! my name is Kyle üëã`. I code with Typescript

  console.log(backEnd.code()); 
  // OUTPUTS: Hey! my name is Kelly üëã. I would write something like 'SELECT * FROM users;'
  ```

  * üîë Finally, we override the `sayHi` method for `Frontend` and `Backend`. See how the function behaves based on the different objects we have created after modifying the `sayHi` method.

  ```js
  // Override the sayHi method for both Frontend and Backend (polymorphism)
  FrontEnd.prototype.sayHi = () =>
    console.log('Hello, I am part of the Front End team');

  Backend.prototype.sayHi = () =>

  * üîë  Polymorphism simplifies handling objects that present the same interface but are implemented differently. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the benefit on using this type of polymorphism in our code?

  * üôã It allows us to write less code and extend functionality for specific types of objects

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Inheritance), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Promises (5 min) // 07-Ins-Promises 

* Open [07-Ins-Promises](../.../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/07-Ins-Promises/index.js) in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë When we run the file, we notice that we get an error with an output of "Child has bad grades"

  * üîë If we examine the code we can also see that there is a promise that is either being rejected or resolved based on some some condition.

  * üîë Promises in code follow the same logic they do in real life.

  * In our case we are examining a function that mirrors an example of a real life promise. The parents have promised to get their kid a Nintendo Switch if they get good grades in school. We can see the output change based on the value of `goodGrades` being true or false.

  ```js
  const goodGrades = false;

  // Promise
  const willGetSwitch = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Check for a desireable outcome, if so resolve the promise
    if (goodGrades) {
      const reward = {
        name: 'Nintendo Switch',
        desired: true,
      };
      resolve(reward);

      // Otherwise reject the promise
    } else {
      const issue = new Error('Child has bad grades');
      reject(issue);
    }
  });
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã We can build this by returning a promise that resolves if the student has good grades and rejects if they have bad grades

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [08-Stu-Promises](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/08-Stu-Promises/README.md)`.

### 13. Student Do: Promises (15 min) 08-Stu-Promises

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [08-Stu-Promises](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/08-Stu-Promises/README.md)`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# üèóÔ∏è Refactor Function to use Promises

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to write asynchronous functions in a cleaner and easier to read fashion using promises.

* As a developer, I want to have the ability to refactor functions that use callbacks to instead return a promise. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I refactor the function using callbacks, `practiceCoding`, inside of `practiceCodingPromise`.

* It's done when `practiceCodingPromise` returns a promise.

* It is complete when the function `practiceCodingPromise` is called using the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. 


## üí° Hints

* How can we use the resolve method to handle a fulfillment of the promise?
* How can we use the reject method to handle the failure of a promise?
* How do promises in real life relate to promises in javascript?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could we resolve multiple promises at once?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: Promises (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with promises? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous task and its return value.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Promises are great for allowing us to return handlers instead of the return value itself.

  * ‚úîÔ∏è There only three states that a promise can be in
    * *pending*: initial state that is neither resolved or rejected
    * *fulfilled*: operation was resolved or successful
    * *rejected* the operation was rejected and failed
  
  * Promises can be chained and we have most likely used them already without realizing it

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

    ```
    @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
    ```

  * üîë @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * üôã @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
