Trilogy as a company values transparency and data-driven change quite highly. As we grow, we know there will be areas that need improvement. It‚Äôs hard for us to know what these areas are unless we‚Äôre asking questions. Your candid input truly matters to us, as you are vital members of the Trilogy team. In addition to the individual feedback at the end of lesson plans
we would appreciate your feedback at the following link:

## Overview

In this class we will be introducing students to the usage of JavaScript constructors and how they can be used to dynamically create objects with similar schemas.

`Summary: Complete activities 1-4 in Unit 11`

## Instructor's Notes

* Constructors are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications. Make sure your students have a firm understanding of how objects function.

* At the beginning of this class, make sure to go over the basics of objects once again so as to help your students recall how they are created and used. This will ultimately help them in understanding constructors better.

## Learning Objectives

* By the end of class students will be able to...

  * Use OOP to create a banking application.

  * Use constructor functions to create new objects.

  * Use object prototypes to add methods to objects.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Class (5 mins)

* Welcome your students to class and tell them that today we will be revisiting objects and building upon our past knowledge of them to create more dynamic object-oriented applications.


### 2. Students Do: Raining Cats and Dogs (15 mins)

* Direct students to the first activity, found in [01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/01-Stu_Cats-And-Dogs)

```md
# Cats and Dogs

In this activity you will make a cat object and dog object each with three keys.

## Instructions

* Make a dogs object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of true

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

* Next make a cats object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of false

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark

* Make the cat meow

## üèÜBONUS

* Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.

* See if there is anyway to further optimize your code.
```

### 3. Instructor Do: Review Raining Cats and Dogs (10 mins)
