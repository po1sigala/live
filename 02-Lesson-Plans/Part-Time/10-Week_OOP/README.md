# Unit 10 Instructor Overview: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

In this unit, we will be covering some very important topics regarding object-oriented programming, including constructors, prototypes, polymorphism, and promises. We will also introduce the students to Test-Driven Development and unit tests. Lastly, we will go over the basics of ES6 classes and how they can help organize our code.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Many students will benefit from more information about prototypal inheritance. Try to provide these students with the resources they need to succeed, but avoid spending too much in-class time if you notice that it's discouraging to struggling students.

* Polymorphism is covered in this unit, but focuses mainly on **method overloading**. Please research this topic before the lesson to familiarize yourself with what exactly method overloading is. 

* Let your students know that this module is very concept-heavy! Object-oriented programming can be very difficult to understand at first, but it is crucial in making them employer-competitive. So reassure them that they are not alone in struggling with this topic and that it is perfectly normal to feel a little lost at first. 

* At the same time, do not feel discouraged if your students aren't understanding the concept after you've tried explaining it to them. It takes time to fully grasp object-oriented programming, so keep encouraging your students and reassuring them that with time and practice, they will understand this! If you are comfortable doing so, share your own struggle and/or personal experiences learning and working with OOP.

* We will also spend a day this unit practicing TDD. Familiarize yourself with `jest` if you've never used it before. Since students have limited exposure to testing, emphasize the importance and benefits of testing. Remind students that just like with other libraries syntax will fall into place over time.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

* Next unit, we will be diving into servers and Express.js to use in the back-end of an application.

* Also, students will start using Heroku to host their web applications. Be sure to install the Heroku CLI on your computer. If needed, you can follow the [Heroku CLI installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/heroku/how-to-install-the-heroku-cli) to install Heroku CLI on your computer.
