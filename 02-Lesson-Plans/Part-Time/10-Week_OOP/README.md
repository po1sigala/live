# Unit 10 Instructor Overview: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)  

## Overview

In this unit we will be introducing students to the usage of JavaScript constructors, classes, promises and the concept of TDD.


Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Constructors and classes are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications. Try to 

* We will also spend a day this unit practicing TDD. Since students have limited exposure to testing, emphasize the importance and benefits of testing. Remind students that just like with other libraries syntax will fall into place over time.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/10-oop/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

* Next unit, we will be diving into servers and Express. Spend as much time as you can making sure that students understand Node.js fundamentals. 

* In the next unit, students will start using Heroku to host their web applications. Students can follow the Heroku deployment installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog to install Node.js on your computer.

* Many students will benefit from more information about prototypal inheritance. Try to provide these students with the resources they need to succeed, but avoid spending too much in-class time if you notice that it's discouraging to struggling students.

* Polymorphism is covered in this unit, but focuses mainly on **method overloading**. Please research this topic before the lesson to familiarize yourself with what exactly method overloading is.
