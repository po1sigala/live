# 10.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Classes

## Overview 

This unit will cover the basics of ES6 classes and how they can help you when organizing and writing code. This unit touches on three areas, implementing classes, utilizing subclasses, and managing multiple classes. Students will learn the benefits of OOP and learn how to apply many OOP practices in their code.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Classes` through `28-Mini-Project`.

* Classes are a broad topic and as a result, it may be hard to remember a time when classes were unfamiliar to you. Review the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) on ES6 classes before this class to focus on the most basic components.

* Today's lesson will rely heavily on ES6 classes. It is recommended that you spend some time getting familiar with classes, subclasses, and the `super()` method before class starts. 

* In the next unit, students will start using Heroku. Advise the students to sign up for a Heroku account and have the Heroku CLI installed **before** the next unit. **TODO** - LINK TO HEROKU CLI INSTALL BLOG POST [FSFG-997](https://trilogyed.atlassian.net/browse/FSFG-997)

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement classes to create characters in an RPG game.

* Extend basic vehicle classes with additional functionality. 

* Implement multiple classes with differing purposes to practice the OOP paradigm.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Classes are a round peg in a square hole when it comes to Javascript. They take an existing OOP concept and emulate it in a prototype-based language. Up until now we have been working with constructors to emulate object oriented design. Classes make things easier for developers coming from other OOP languages, but also help everyone with easier to read syntax.

* The language specification known as ES6 provides a class syntax, but the interesting thing about Javascript classes is that they don't actually provide any new functionality. They are what many developers describe as "syntactical sugar".

* You may be asking what in the world is syntactical sugar. The best way to think about it is making the syntax "sweeter" to humans. It makes thing easier to read and generally more pleasant. In this case, we are getting rid of the bitter taste of prototypes and inheritance and sweetening the recipe with some ES6 classes. 

* Throughout this unit, keep in mind that what is happening under the hood is the same thing we have been working on all along with constructor functions and prototypical inheritance. Lets break down one of the classes so we can stop worrying about what they will look like:

```js
// Developer class
class Developer {
  constructor(name) {
    this.developerName = name;
  }

  sayHi() {
    return `Hey! my name is ${this.developerName} üëã`;
  }
}

// We extend Developer into a subclass called `Frontend` and give it its own `saySkill` method
class FrontEnd extends Developer {
  constructor(name, stack) {
    super(name);
    this.techStack = stack;
  }

  saySkill() {
    return `${this.sayHi()}, I code with ${this.techStack}`;
  }
}

// We instantiate new objects using the "new" keyword
const dev = new Developer('Amanda');
const frontend = new FrontEnd('Kyle', 'Typescript');
```

All of this may seem new, but soon you will be comparing what you know about constructors with classes. Classes are fun to work with, so lets get started!

### 2. Instructor Demo: Classes (5 min)

* Open `21-Ins-Classes` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node shape` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë  This is what an ES6 class declaration looks like. Unlike a constructor function, we do not declare the parameters of the new object at the top of the function. Instead, we use a function that is built in to classes called `constructor`.

    ```js
    class Shape {
    // Just like constructor functions, classes can accept arguments
        constructor(area, perimeter) {
            this.area = area;
            this.perimeter = perimeter;
    }
    ```

  * üîë The syntax for class methods is different than that of any function we've seen before. Instead of using arrow functions or `.prototype`, the syntax looks very similar to the way we declare functions, just without the `function` keyword.
  
    ```js
    printInfo() {
        console.log(`Area: ${this.area}`);
        console.log(`Perimeter: ${this.perimeter}`);
    }
    ```

  * Although we are now using classes in JavaScript, this does not mean that JavaScript has classical inheritance like some other programming languages. Fundamentally, JavaScript still works the same. Inheritance still happens using prototypes. The `class` syntax merely serves as **syntactical sugar** to make developers' lives easier.

  * Much like constructor functions, we instantiate objects the same way we did with constructor functions.

    ```js
    const shape = new Shape(25, 25);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the value of `this` within the `printInfo` method?

  * üôã `this` is equal to the instance of the object that is created with the `new` keyword. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build something like this?

  * üôã We could look up more information on how to properly use the ES6 class syntax

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu-Classes`.

### 3. Student Do: Prototypes (15 min) (22-Stu_Classes)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu-Classes`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # üèóÔ∏è Write and Implement Classes

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to make two RPG characters match against each other using ES6 classes.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have opened [character.js](Unsolved/character.js) and updated the `Character` class so that it instantiates objects with the following properties:

    * Name
    * Strength
    * HitPoints

  * It's done when I create a `printStats()` class method that prints the name, strength, and hitPoints for a character.

  * It's done when I create a `attack(opponent)` method that a character can use to deal damage (equal to their strength) to their opponents hitPoints.  

  * It's done when I create two instances of a character, giving them different names, strength, and hitPoints. 

  * It's done when I make each character take turns attacking each other using `setInterval`. 

  * It's done when I have invoke `printStats()` after each attack to visualize the battle.

  * It's done when I create a `isAlive` method to check if each character has more than 0 hitPoints every turn.
    
  * It'd done when I check if either character has been defeated and stop the interval and end the game.

  ## üí° Hints

  * How can we start small? Can we benefit from first trying to make one character attack another until the game is over?

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * * How can we add validation to ensure that each character is provided the proper 3 arguments when created. If any of the arguments are not present, `throw` an error.


  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Classes (10 min) (22-Stu-Classes)  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with ES6 classes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `constructor()`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è `this`

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Method syntax

* Open `Solved/character.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * When we examine the content of our `character.js` file, we notice that it accepts three arguments.
  
  * üîë Part of the bonus was to check to make sure that the 3 arguments are provided. Here we check each individually but we could have also checked the data type.

  ```js
  class Character {
    constructor(name, strength, hitPoints) {
      // Bonus
      if (!name) {
      throw new Error("You are missing the name.");
      }
      if (!strength) {
        throw new Error("You are missing the strength.");
      }
      if (!hitPoints) {
        throw new Error("You are missing the hitPoints.");
      }
      this.name = name;
      this.strength = strength;
      this.hitPoints = hitPoints;
    }
  ```

  * `isAlive` checks if a character has 0 or less hitPoints.

  ```js
  isAlive() {
    if (this.hitPoints <= 0) {
      console.log(`${this.name} has been defeated!`)
      return false;
    }
    return true;
  };
  ```

  * `Attack` deals damage to the provided opponent equal to the characters strength.

  ```js
  attack(opponent) {
    console.log(`${this.name} hit ${opponent.name} for ${this.strength}`)
    opponent.hitPoints -= this.strength;
  };
  ```

  * After we create two characters, we initialize the game to start with Beatrix.

  ```js
  const grace = new Character("Grace", 30, 75);
  const dijkstra = new Character("Dijkstra", 20, 105);

  let graceTurn = true;
  ```

  * After creating an interval, we toggle the turn.

  * Next, we check to see if either Grace or Dijkstra has been defeated. If so, we clear the interval and end the game. If not, we have Dijkstra or Grace attack, depending on whose turn it is.

  ```js
  const turnInterval = setInterval(() => {
    graceTurn = !graceTurn;

    if(!grace.isAlive() || !dijkstra.isAlive()) {
      clearInterval(turnInterval)
      console.log("Game over!")
    } else if(graceTurn) {
      grace.attack(dijkstra);
      dijkstra.printStats();
    } else {
      dijkstra.attack(grace);
      grace.printStats();
    }
  }, 2000)
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What would our constructor method look like if we instead validated the data for each argument instead of whether or not it was null?

  * üôã We could have used the `typeof` method in Javascript to check the data type in a conditional statement.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
