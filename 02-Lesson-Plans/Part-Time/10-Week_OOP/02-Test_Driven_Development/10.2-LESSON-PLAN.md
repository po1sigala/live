# 10.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: 

## Overview 

Today's lesson plan will introduce students to test driven development, unit tests, and mock data. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `XX-Ins_Demo-Title` through `20-Stu_Mock-Fs`.

* @TODO Every Instructor Notes block begins with the preceding bullet, which outlines the activities that will be covered during class.

* @TODO Empathize with the instructor. If you only had one hour to prepare for class, what are the things you would want to know up front? What are the potential pitfalls in class? Where are students going to get hung up? 

* @TODO Set the instructor up for success.

* Testing frameworks often use a lot of specific methods that read like plain english. You may benefit from creating a few failing tests of your own and then write the code to make them pass to help refresh your memory. You may also benefit from installing the [Jest Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andys8.jest-snippets) plugin for VSCode.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the benefits of test-driven-development (**TDD**).

* Use **unit tests** before as a way to define code requirements for code that hasn't been written yet.

* Write **unit tests** for pre-existing JavaScript functions.

* Use **mocks** to test side effects such as reading/writing to the file system, printing to the console, and AJAX requests.

* Use the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern to structure test code.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Test driven development is a process and methodology. In order to prime our brain for learning, let's go over some terms that we will see throughout this unit. We will also discuss a very simple flow of how test driven development works (TDD).

* Terms:
  * **Unit Tests**: Unit tests ensure reliability and expected behavior of things like functions or classes. Unit tests assert that the unit being tested returns the expected output.
  
  * **Integration Tests**: Integration tests ensure proper cooperation of units in your application. Integration tests may focus on an API, user input, or user interface that may have subsequent actions like writing to a database or logging output.
  
  * **End-to-end Tests**: End-to-end tests assert that the application will function as expected from the perspective of a user. These tests usually focus almost entirely on the user interface of an application.

* We will be creating tests *before* we write our code. This is the core concept of how TDD works. We let the need to make tests pass dictate how our code should be written. This flow sets up a contract-like expectation for yourself and other developers. It also keeps the development process focused.

* TDD Cycle: We are going to focus on the basics and expand on each step in this unit, but for now all you need to know are the basic steps to TDD:

  1. Write a failing test
  2. Make the test pass
  3. Refactor the implementation


### 2. Instructor Demo: TDD Dissect (5 min)

* Open [11-Ins-TDD](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/11-Ins-TDD/index.js) in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * When we look at the code in `index.js`, we can see several methods chained together that seem to preform specific operations one after another.

  ```js
  const value = new Arithmetic(4)
    .plus(8)
    .plus(15)
    .minus(16)
    .minus(23)
    .plus(42)
    .plus(108)
    .value();
  ```

  * We also see that we are importing an object called `Arithmetic` at the top of the file.

  ```js
  const Arithmetic = require('./arithmetic');
  ```

  * We can tell by looking at the `new` keyword on line 3 that `value` is an instance of `Arithmetic`. This means that it will inherit the methods on the `Arithmetic` prototype chain.

  * 🔑 If we right click on the word `Arithmetic` at the top of the file and click "Go to definition", we will be brought to the file that declares all the methods we saw in `index.js`.

  ```js
  Arithmetic.prototype.plus = function(num = 0) {
    const newNumber = this.number + num;

    return new Arithmetic(newNumber);
  };

  Arithmetic.prototype.minus = function(num = 0) {
    const newNumber = this.number - num;

    return new Arithmetic(newNumber);
  };

  Arithmetic.prototype.value = function() {
    return this.number;
  };
  ```
  * In order to test that these methods take the provided input and return the correct output, we have created a `/tests/` folder and an `arithmetic.test.js` file.

  * 🔑 One important thing to remember is that while we are dissecting the code currently, the way you would go about building this is to create the tests first. Hence, the "test driven" part of TDD.

  * After importing `Arithmetic` just like we did in `index.js`, we start with a describe statement. This groups together several related tests and also helps with readability.

  * The `it` portion of this test describes how the function should behave in a successful test case. Consider our first it statement: 

    ```js
    describe("Arithmetic", () => {
    describe("Initialization", () => {
      it("should return an object containing a 'number' property when called with the 'new' keyword", () => {
        const obj = new Arithmetic();

        expect("number" in obj).toEqual(true);
      });
    ```

  * The following code block then creates a new instance of Arithmetic and uses the `expect` method to test values. In our case, we are testing to see that the key `number` has a truthy value in our newly created object.
  
  * 🔑 Now that we understand how the tests are written, lets run our tests:

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```
  
  * We should see the output in the terminal from our testing framework called `jest`. All the passing tests will appear in green and all failing tests will appear in red.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We would first build the tests, and then create the code to make the tests pass.

  * ☝️ What is the significance of the `expect`, `it`, and `toEqual` methods in our testing framework?

  * 🙋 Each of these are methods that tell the testing framework what to expect in terms of output from our functions. You can learn more about how to use these by reading the [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect#expectvalue)

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in [12-Stu-TDD](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/12-Stu_TDD/README.md).

### 3. Student Do: Test Driven Development (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [12-Stu-TDD](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/12-Stu_TDD/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  # 🏗️ Implement Tests

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to create tests to define and test the expected output for code that hasn't been implemented yet. 

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have written a test for the `reverse` method.
    * The `reverse` method should take a string as an argument and return a new reversed version of the string. e.g. "Hello" should return "elloH".

  * It's done when I have written a test for the `isPalindrome` method.
    * `isPalindrome` should take a string as an argument and return the boolean `true` if the provided string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is the same backwards as it is forwards, e.g. "racecar". Return `false` is the string is not a palindrome.
    
  * It's done when I have written a test for the `capitalize` method.
    * The `capitalize` method should take a string as an argument and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized. e.g. "hello world!" should return "Hello World!".

  * **Important**: Write code for the tests only, the only file you will be modifying is `tests/algo.test.js`. Initially all of your tests will fail since these methods are empty, but using the tests you can define how each method _should_ work.

  ## 💡 Hints

  * How can we use the `describe`, `it` and `expect` functions in Jest to aid to check for expected behavior?

  * Is it normal for all the tests be fail at first? If so, why?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Where can you find some examples of well written tests?
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Test Driven Development (10 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with TDD? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ By providing our functions different inputs, we can make sure they work correctly by checking their return values.

  * ✔️ Tests ensure our functions carry out their logic the same way every time.

  * ✔️ Tests allow other developers to quickly see what a function or suite of functions should be achieving.

* Open [12-Stu-TDD](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/12-Stu_TDD/Solved/) in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We first require the file containing the functions we would like to test.

  ```js
  const Algo = require("../algo");
  ```

  * We can then use the `describe` function to begin setting up our tests. We are going to start with the `Algo` definition.

  ```js
  describe("Algo", () => {
  ```

  * Now we can begin to test specific functionality. Here we are saying that when passed a string and reversed, it returns the proper reversed string. the `it` method allows us to describe what the function should do in plain english given certain parameters.

  ```js
  describe("reverse", () => {
    it("should reverse a given string", () => {
      const str = "Hello World!";
      const reversed = "!dlroW olleH";

      const result = new Algo().reverse(str);

      expect(result).toEqual(reversed);
    });
  });
  ```

  * 🔑 In each case, we're checking to see what the method returns given a certain input. We setup the same testing for `isPalindrome` and capitalize.

  ```js
  describe("isPalindrome", () => {
    it("should return true if a string is a palindrome", () => {
      const str = "racecar";

      const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);

      expect(result).toEqual(true);
    });

    it("should return false if a string is not a palindrome", () => {
      const str = "neon";

      const result = new Algo().isPalindrome(str);

      expect(result).toEqual(false);
    });
  ```

  * 🔑 Even though we haven't written code for these methods yet, it would be easy for someone to understand what the methods should do based on these tests.

  ```js
    describe("capitalize", () => {
      it("should take a string and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized", () => {
        const str = "capitalize every first word of the string.";
        const capitalized = "Capitalize Every First Word Of The String.";

        const result = new Algo().capitalize(str);

        expect(result).toEqual(capitalized);
      });
    });
  });
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Do you think these are good tests?

  * 🙋 Yes, if they fail, it means the code isn't doing what it should.

  * ☝️ Do you think these are _enough_ tests?

  * 🙋 No, it doesn't account for things like empty strings, what should happen if given invalid arguments or edge cases like palindromes with different casing or spaces.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Tests Pass (5 min)

* Open [13-Ins-Pass-Tests](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/13-Ins-Pass-Tests/fizz.js) in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* First open `package.json` and point out our developer dependency of `jest`, then run `npm i` in the directory.

* Run `npm run test` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 When we run our test, it checks in `package.json` from any script with the key `test`. As we noted earlier, our test script is defined with a value of `jest`.

  * 🔑 When `jest` is invoked, it will look for files matching a specific pattern of `[filename].test.js`. It will find our one and only test in the `/tests` directory and run it.

  * We can see that all the tests pass, but now lets examine the code that allows these tests to pass:

  ```js
  const fizzBuzz = (num) => { }

  module.exports = fizzBuzz
  ```

  * First we export our function so that `jest` doesn't throw an error right out of the gate. Then we head back to our test file to examine the first case:

  ```js
    it('should return the number if not a multiple of three or five', () => {
      expect(fizzBuzz([1])).toBe('1');
      expect(fizzBuzz([1, 2])).toBe('1, 2');
  });
  ```

  * The following code will map over teh array of numbers that is provided to the function and examine each of them individually using the variable `singleNum`

  ```js
  num.map((singleNum) => {
      const multipleOf3 = singleNum % 3 === 0;
      const multipleOf5 = singleNum % 5 === 0;
  ```

  * Here we are setting some boolean values to variables called `multipleOf3` and `multipleOf5`. We then use these boolean values in our conditional statements:

  * If the number is divisible by three and five, return `fizzBuzz`
  ```js
        if (multipleOf3 && multipleOf5) {
        return 'FizzBuzz';
      }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

### 6. Student Do: Pass Tests (15 min) 14-Stu-Pass-Tests (unsolved)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [14-Stu_Pass-Tests](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/14-Stu_Pass-Tests/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗️ Implement Code to Make Tests Pass

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write code that will allow my tests to pass

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have written code for function in `algo.js`.

* It's done when I have ran `npm run test` in the terminal to verify that I correctly implemented each method before moving on.

* It's done when the tests in `tests/algo.test.js` pass.
