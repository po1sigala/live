# 10.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: 

## Overview 

Today's lesson plan will introduce students to test driven development, unit tests, and mock data. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `XX-Ins_Demo-Title` through `20-Stu_Mock-Fs`.

* @TODO Every Instructor Notes block begins with the preceding bullet, which outlines the activities that will be covered during class.

* @TODO Empathize with the instructor. If you only had one hour to prepare for class, what are the things you would want to know up front? What are the potential pitfalls in class? Where are students going to get hung up? 

* @TODO Set the instructor up for success.

* Testing frameworks often use a lot of specific methods that read like plain english. You may benefit from creating a few failing tests of your own and then write the code to make them pass to help refresh your memory. You may also benefit from installing the [Jest Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=andys8.jest-snippets) plugin for VSCode.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the benefits of test-driven-development (**TDD**).

* Use **unit tests** before as a way to define code requirements for code that hasn't been written yet.

* Write **unit tests** for pre-existing JavaScript functions.

* Use **mocks** to test side effects such as reading/writing to the file system, printing to the console, and AJAX requests.

* Use the Arrange, Act, Assert pattern to structure test code.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Test driven development is a process and methodology. In order to prime our brain for learning, let's go over some terms that we will see throughout this unit. We will also discuss a very simple flow of how test driven development works (TDD).

* Terms:
  * **Unit Tests**: Unit tests ensure reliability and expected behavior of things like functions or classes. Unit tests assert that the unit being tested returns the expected output.
  
  * **Integration Tests**: Integration tests ensure proper cooperation of units in your application. Integration tests may focus on an API, user input, or user interface that may have subsequent actions like writing to a database or logging output.
  
  * **End-to-end Tests**: End-to-end tests assert that the application will function as expected from the perspective of a user. These tests usually focus almost entirely on the user interface of an application.

* We will be creating tests *before* we write our code. This is the core concept of how TDD works. We let the need to make tests pass dictate how our code should be written. This flow sets up a contract-like expectation for yourself and other developers. It also keeps the development process focused.

* TDD Cycle: We are going to focus on the basics and expand on each step in this unit, but for now all you need to know are the basic steps to TDD:

  1. Write a failing test
  2. Make the test pass
  3. Refactor the implementation


### 2. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 min) // 11-Ins-TBD

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * üîë @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?

  * üôã @TODO { YES, HOW? }

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
@TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: { ACTIVITY NAME } (10 min) 12-STU-TDD-Dissect (solved)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with `@TODO TOPIC`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THIS }

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THAT }

  * ‚úîÔ∏è @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * @TODO { WE DO THIS AND THE RESULT IS THAT }

  ```
  @TODO ADD CODE SNIPPET, TABBED
  ```

  * üîë @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * üôã @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 min) // 13-INS-Pass-Tests (TODO!)

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in [14-Stu_Pass-Tests](../../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/01-Activities/14-Stu_Pass-Tests/README.md).

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üèóÔ∏è Implement Code to Make Tests Pass

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write code that will allow my tests to pass

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have written code for function in `algo.js`.

* It's done when I have ran `npm run test` in the terminal to verify that I correctly implemented each method before moving on.

* It's done when the tests in `tests/algo.test.js` pass.

---

## üí° Hints

How can we use the tests themselves in `tests/algo.test.js` to give us clues on how to write our function?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What part of our code in the `/Unsolved` folder is telling node what to do when we run `npm run test`
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Pass Tests (10 min) 14-Stu-Pass-Tests (solved)

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with TDD thus far? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è This exercise is not only good practice for understand how to make our code pass, but also great experience with some common interview questions

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Test driven development is a great way to break down a problem into it's most basic parts

  * ‚úîÔ∏è The tests that are written help us think about the inputs and outputs that each function is given and expected to return.
