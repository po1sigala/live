# Unit 06 Instructor Overview: Server-Side APIs

## Overview

In this unit, you will use the `fetch()` method to make requests to the GitHub API and convert the returned data into HTML elements. You will also discuss the client-server model and leverage the Chrome DevTools Network tab to verify response statuses.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* The MDN web docs use ES6 in their Fetch API examples, but the activities will continue to use ES5 syntax, since that is what students will be familiar with.

* Along with the Fetch API, students will also briefly experiment with cURL, `XMLHttpRequest` objects, and `$.ajax()`.

* Students will use the GitHub API for activities and the OpenWeather API for their homework. The OpenWeather API requires signing up for a key.

## Career Connection

Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career-Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/06-Server-Side-APIs/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

For the next two units, students will work on their first group project. Groups should consist of 3-4 students each. Don't let students work on a project alone, as this is their only chance to truly learn Git collaboration.
