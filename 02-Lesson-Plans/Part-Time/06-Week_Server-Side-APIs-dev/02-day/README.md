# XX.X Part-Time Lesson Plan: { @TODO Descriptive and Professional Title }

## Overview 

@TODO Write a two or three-sentence overview of the lesson plan.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_Demo_Title` through `20-Stu_Documentation_Location`

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. The majority of activities today continue off fetch with the GitHub API, you will also be introducing the Chrome DevTools Network Activity tab and document.location

* @TODO Empathize with the instructor. If you only had one hour to prepare for class, what are the things you would want to know up front? What are the potential pitfalls in class? Where are students going to get hung up? 

* Throughout the class remind the students, that this will get easier as they gain familiarity with the GitHub API documentation and using Fetch.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Utilize the Chrome DevTools Network Activity Tab to debug resources. FIXME:

* Implement and utilize response status codes from a fetch request.

* Deconstruct multiple parameters in an API request URL.

* Implement fetch options for the fetch request.

* Utilize document location to replace the URL in the browser.
