# 06.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Fetch API Review and Git Collaboration

## Overview 

In this lesson, students will spend some time reviewing topics they've learned throughout the course so far to help prepare them for the mini-project and homework. They'll also learn both how to set up a GitHub repository for collaboration and how to actually collaborate with others on an application. The idea is to show students how everything they've learned is used in a slightly bigger application.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Review-One` through `27-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Since today is more about review, the first two instructor demos and student activities will demonstrate the same application at different complexity levels. Please take a moment or two to review each variation and pull out some talking points of your own if there is something you find worth mentioning.

* The two Git activities are intended to get students into a mindset of knowing what steps to take when collaborating with others in a single repository. If time allows, walk students through all the steps and demonstrate how it all works.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with either `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Reverse engineer and learn by reviewing larger applications.

* Set up their GitHub repositories for a collaborative environment.

* Successfully collaborate with others in a single GitHub repository.

* Build a larger-scale application that puts all previously learned skills to use.
