# 06.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Fetch API Review and Git Collaboration

## Overview 

In this lesson, students will spend some time reviewing topics they've learned throughout the course so far to help prepare them for the mini-project and homework. They'll also learn both how to set up a GitHub repository for collaboration and how to actually collaborate with others on an application. The idea is to show students how everything they've learned is used in a slightly bigger application.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Review-One` through `27-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Since today is more about review, the first two instructor demos and student activities will demonstrate the same application at different complexity levels. Please take a moment or two to review each variation and pull out some talking points of your own if there is something you find worth mentioning.

* The two Git activities are intended to get students into a mindset of knowing what steps to take when collaborating with others in a single repository. If time allows, walk students through all the steps and demonstrate how it all works.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with either `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Reverse engineer and learn from reviewing larger applications.

* Set up their GitHub repositories for a collaborative environment.

* Successfully collaborate with others in a single GitHub repository.

* Build a larger-scale application that puts all previously learned skills to use.

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Review Part One (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with how this application works? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Font Awesome Icons

  * ✔️ HTML Data Attributes and `.getAttribute()`

  * ✔️ Query URL with params

* Open `22-Stu_Review-Part-One/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use the library called Font Awesome to use SVG based icons in our HTML:

  ```html
  <!-- In the <head> -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.11.2/css/all.min.css">

  <!-- In the <body> -->
  <h1 class="app-title">
    <!-- The `<i>` element is for icons. These classes come from the Font Awesome font icon library. -->
    <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Git it Done!
  </h1>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use HTML data attributes on our language buttons so we can read the value when the button is clicked to form a request in `homepage.js`:

  ```html
  <!-- These data-attribute values will be used to search for repositories when a button is clicked. -->
  <button data-language="javascript" class="btn">JavaScript</button>
  <button data-language="html" class="btn">HTML</button>
  <button data-language="css" class="btn">CSS</button>
  ```

  * We create an empty HTML element to be a container to hold response data from the GitHub API

* Open `22-Stu_Review-Part-One/Solved/assets/js/homepage.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We read the HTML data attributes from the buttons when we click them:

  ```js
  // In `homepage.js`
  var buttonClickHandler = function (event) {
    // `event.target` is a reference to the DOM element of what programming language button was clicked on the page
    var language = event.target.getAttribute('data-language');

    // If there is no language read from the button, don't attempt to fetch repos
    if (language) {
      getFeaturedRepos(language);

      repoContainerEl.textContent = '';
    }
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 We piece together the query URL before making our API request to GitHub and add parameters as needed:

  ```js
  var apiUrl = 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=' + language + '+is:featured&sort=help-wanted-issues';
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ With all of the skills we have learned, could we build something like this?

  * 🙋 Yes, we can!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [GitHub API Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Review Part Two (5 min) 

* Open `23-Ins_Review-Part-Two/index.html` in your browser, search for a GitHub user or select a button to display repos, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Now when we select one of the repositories, we're taken to a second page where we get the list of issues for the repository.

  * 🔑 We get that information by including the repository name in the URL as a parameter (i.e. `single-repo.html?repo=angular-ui/ui-grid`) and searching for that repo.

* Open `23-Ins_Review-Part-Two/assets/js/homepage.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We create those URLs when we write the repos to the page in the `displayRepos()` function:
  
  ```js
  // In the `displayRepos()` function
  var repoEl = document.createElement('a');
  repoEl.classList = 'list-item flex-row justify-space-between align-center';
  repoEl.setAttribute('href', './single-repo.html?repo=' + repoName);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we get that information from the URL on the second page?

  * 🙋 We could use the browser's `location` object!

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Review-Part-Two/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Review Part Two (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Review-Part-Two/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to "Git It Done" Application - Part Two

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    *  For an open source contributor, what is the significance of knowing if an issue has an associated pull request or not?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Review Part Two (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with an application scaled out like this? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ URL search params

  * ✔️ API response pagination

  * ✔️ If nothing to display, let user know

* Open `24-Stu_Review-Part-Two/Solved/assets/js/single.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We retrieve the repository name from the URL in `getRepoName()` so we can use it in a `fetch()` request:

    ```js
    // This is coming from the URL search bar in the browser. It is what comes after the `?`.
    var queryString = document.location.search;
    var repoName = queryString.split('=')[1];
    ```

  * If there is no repo name in the URL, then let's send the user back to the homepage:

  ```js
  document.location.replace('./index.html');
  ```

  * 🔑 Since GitHub only returns 30 issues at a time, we should check if there are more than 30 and let users know about it. GitHub lets us know about it with a `Link` property in the response header that gives us the next query url if we wanted to display the next 30 issues:

  ```js
  // See this value in the Chrome DevTools network tab
  if (response.headers.get('Link')) {
    displayWarning(repo);
  }
  ``` 

  * 🔑 If we search a repository with no issues, we should let users know instead of displaying a blank screen with this code in `displayIssues()`:

  ```js
  if (issues.length === 0) {
    issueContainerEl.textContent = 'This repo has no open issues!';
    return;
  }
  ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would GitHub limit its API response size to 30 issues?

  * 🙋 If a server were to respond with all possible data, it could impact the performance of the request and slow down the application. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: { ACTIVITY NAME } (5 min) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * 🔑 @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

  ```md
  # Unit 06 Mini Project: Library of Congress Search Tool

  In this activity, you will work with a group to build an application that searches and displays results from the Library of Congress API.

  ## Instructions

  * The completed application should meet the following criteria:

    * As a user, I can submit a search query from the application to request data and receive a response from the Library of Congress.

    * As a user, I can either perform a generic search for data in all formats or I can select a format in the form to help filter results.

    * As a user, I can see all of the results of my search displayed on a separate page.

    * As a user, I can conduct additional searches from the results page as well.

  * To learn about how to use this API, check out the Requests section of the [Library of Congress API documentation.](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/)

  ### The Home Page

  * The home page (`index.html`) should have the following:

    * A simple, well thought out UI.

    * A form with a text input field to capture a search query and an option select dropdown to capture the format of the search query. The options in the dropdown should be a list of the possible format values listed in the [Library of Congress API docs.](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html#format)

    * A browser event listener attached to the form to execute a function upon submission, which will capture both form values and redirect the user to a search results page with those values included in the URL as query parameters. This will use the browser's `location.replace()` method.

    * If there is no format selected from the dropdown, the URL should look something like this:

      ```http
      /search-results.html?q=dogs&format=
      ```

    * If there is a format selected from the dropdown, the URL should look something like this instead:

      ```http
      /search-results.html?q=dogs&format=photos
      ```

  ### The Search Results Page

  * The search results page (`search-results.html`) should have and do the following:

    * On page load, if there are query parameters, immediately parse them and use them in a request URL to fetch data from the Library of Congress API.

    * If there is a value for the format query parameter, use the [format endpoint](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html#format) to search for something based on the chosen format.

    * If there is no value for the format query parameter, use the [search endpoint](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html#search) to search for all types of data.

    * The response from the API request will then be displayed on the page. It is up to your and your team to determine what data is important to be displayed from [the overall response object,](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/responses.html) but you must use data from the `results` property in the response object.

    * The same form from the home page should be here as well. Instead of redirecting a user to another page, however, it will perform a search right on the page and display the new results.

  ## Assets

  * Here is a mockup of what the home page can look like:

    ![The home page shows a search bar with the ability to select a format from a dropdown menu.](./Images/01-homepage.png)

  * Here is a mockup of what the search results page can look like:

    ![The search results page displays results from a search conducted in the form on the left side of the page.](./Images/02-search-results-page.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * Will every result have the same data? If no, how will we handle printing it to the page?

  * Can the form design and functionality from the home page be reused for the search results page?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  * Use your new Git collaboration knowledge to build this project!
