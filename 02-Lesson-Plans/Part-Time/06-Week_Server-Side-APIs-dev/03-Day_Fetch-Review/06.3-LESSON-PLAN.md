# 06.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Fetch API Review and Git Collaboration

## Overview 

In this lesson, students will spend some time reviewing topics they've learned throughout the course so far to help prepare them for the mini-project and homework. They'll also learn both how to set up a GitHub repository for collaboration and how to actually collaborate with others on an application. The idea is to show students how everything they've learned is used in a slightly bigger application.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Review-One` through `27-Stu_Mini-Project`.

* Since today is more about review, the first two instructor demos and student activities will demonstrate the same application at different complexity levels. Please take a moment or two to review each variation and pull out some talking points of your own if there is something you find worth mentioning.

* The two Git activities are intended to get students into a mindset of knowing what steps to take when collaborating with others in a single repository. If time allows, walk students through all the steps and demonstrate how it all works.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with either `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Reverse engineer and learn from reviewing larger applications.

* Set up their GitHub repositories for a collaborative environment.

* Successfully collaborate with others in a single GitHub repository.

* Build a larger-scale application that puts all previously learned skills to use.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Congratulate the class on how much they've learned up to this point, as their new skills in working with server-side APIs has made them knowledgeable enough to build more complex applications.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * 🙋 How have we used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together?

  * ☝️ We use HTML to put the page together, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript to handle any updates or changes that occur on the page.

  * 🙋 What name do we use to classify tools like `fetch()`, `document`, `console`, or even jQuery?

  * ☝️ They are all APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces.

  * 🙋 Are these built into the JavaScript language?

  * ☝️ No, they are collections of custom JavaScript functionality that extend our capabilities as developers.

  * 🙋 What about data? How can we use data that we don't explicitly create in our applications?

  * ☝️ We can request that data using the Fetch API and print response data to the page.

  * 🙋 Do we know how to do all of these things?

  * ☝️ Yes, we do!

* Explain that we're going to spend today bringing everything we've learned so far together so we can see how it works in a larger application. Larger applications mean we need more developers on a project, so we'll also learn how to collaborate using Git and GitHub.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Review Part One (5 min) 

* Open `21-Ins_Review-Part-One/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we search for a GitHub user, a list of their repositories and number of issues appear.

  * 🔑 We can also perform a search for a language's most popular repos by clicking one of the buttons.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 With HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Fetch to query GitHub's API. Everything we've learned so far!

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Review-Part-One/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Review Part One (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Review-Part-One/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to "Git It Done" Application - Part One 

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in the HTML and JavaScript files in [Unsolved](./Unsolved)

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Review Part One (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with how this application works? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Font Awesome Icons

  * ✔️ HTML Data Attributes and `.getAttribute()`

  * ✔️ Query URL with params

* Open `22-Stu_Review-Part-One/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use the library called Font Awesome to use SVG based icons in our HTML:

  ```html
  <!-- In the <head> -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/5.11.2/css/all.min.css">

  <!-- In the <body> -->
  <h1 class="app-title">
    <!-- The `<i>` element is for icons. These classes come from the Font Awesome font icon library. -->
    <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Git it Done!
  </h1>
  ```

  * 🔑 We use HTML data attributes on our language buttons so we can read the value when the button is clicked to form a request in `homepage.js`:

  ```html
  <!-- These data-attribute values will be used to search for repositories when a button is clicked. -->
  <button data-language="javascript" class="btn">JavaScript</button>
  <button data-language="html" class="btn">HTML</button>
  <button data-language="css" class="btn">CSS</button>
  ```

  * We create an empty HTML element to be a container to hold response data from the GitHub API

* Open `22-Stu_Review-Part-One/Solved/assets/js/homepage.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We read the HTML data attributes from the buttons when we click them:

  ```js
  // In `homepage.js`
  var buttonClickHandler = function (event) {
    // `event.target` is a reference to the DOM element of what programming language button was clicked on the page
    var language = event.target.getAttribute('data-language');

    // If there is no language read from the button, don't attempt to fetch repos
    if (language) {
      getFeaturedRepos(language);

      repoContainerEl.textContent = '';
    }
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 We piece together the query URL before making our API request to GitHub and add parameters as needed:

  ```js
  var apiUrl = 'https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=' + language + '+is:featured&sort=help-wanted-issues';
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ With all of the skills we have learned, could we build something like this?

  * 🙋 Yes, we can!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [GitHub API Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Review Part Two (5 min) 

* Open `23-Ins_Review-Part-Two/index.html` in your browser, search for a GitHub user or select a button to display repos, and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Now when we select one of the repositories, we're taken to a second page where we get the list of issues for the repository.

  * 🔑 We get that information by including the repository name in the URL as a parameter (i.e. `single-repo.html?repo=angular-ui/ui-grid`) and searching for that repo.

* Open `23-Ins_Review-Part-Two/assets/js/homepage.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We create those URLs when we write the repos to the page in the `displayRepos()` function:
  
  ```js
  // In the `displayRepos()` function
  var repoEl = document.createElement('a');
  repoEl.classList = 'list-item flex-row justify-space-between align-center';
  repoEl.setAttribute('href', './single-repo.html?repo=' + repoName);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we get that information from the URL on the second page?

  * 🙋 We could use the browser's `location` object!

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Review-Part-Two/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Review Part Two (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Review-Part-Two/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 📐 Add Comments to "Git It Done" Application - Part Two 

  Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [single.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/single.js).

  ## 📝 Note(s)

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    *  For an open source contributor, what is the significance of knowing if an issue has an associated pull request or not?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Review Part Two (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with an application scaled out like this? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ URL search params

  * ✔️ API response pagination

  * ✔️ If nothing to display, let user know

* Open `24-Stu_Review-Part-Two/Solved/assets/js/single.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We retrieve the repository name from the URL in `getRepoName()` so we can use it in a `fetch()` request:

    ```js
    // This is coming from the URL search bar in the browser. It is what comes after the `?`.
    var queryString = document.location.search;
    var repoName = queryString.split('=')[1];
    ```

  * If there is no repo name in the URL, then let's send the user back to the homepage:

  ```js
  document.location.replace('./index.html');
  ```

  * 🔑 Since GitHub only returns 30 issues at a time, we should check if there are more than 30 and let users know about it. GitHub lets us know about it with a `Link` property in the response header that gives us the next query url if we wanted to display the next 30 issues:

  ```js
  // See this value in the Chrome DevTools network tab
  if (response.headers.get('Link')) {
    displayWarning(repo);
  }
  ``` 

  * 🔑 If we search a repository with no issues, we should let users know instead of displaying a blank screen with this code in `displayIssues()`:

  ```js
  if (issues.length === 0) {
    issueContainerEl.textContent = 'This repo has no open issues!';
    return;
  }
  ``` 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would GitHub limit its API response size to 30 issues?

  * 🙋 If a server were to respond with all possible data, it could impact the performance of the request and slow down the application. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Git Repo Setup (5 min) 

* Open [the React GitHub repo](https://github.com/facebook/react) or any other repository that you don't have write access to in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 By default, we can clone anyone else's repository to our machines and make as many commits as we want to the codebase.

  * 🔑 However, we can't push any code back up to the repository if we don't have permission to do so.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we set up our repository to allow other users to contribute directly?

  * 🙋 GitHub has settings for that!

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `25-Stu_Git-Repo-Setup/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Git Repo Setup (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `25-Stu_Git-Repo-Setup/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 10. Instructor Review: Git Repo Setup (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with setting up our repositories? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `.gitignore` file

  * ✔️ Branch protection

  * ✔️ Adding collaborators

* Open a repository you own or create a new one on [GitHub](https://github.com) in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 After creating the repository, it's best that the repository owner creates some of the boilerplate files such as the `.gitignore` file.

  * 🔑 In the repository settings, we make it so no new code can be merged into the `main` branch without at least one other reviewer. This makes it so no one on a team can autonomously merge code into production.

  * 🔑 We can also add collaborators directly by looking them up and inviting them.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would we want to enforce code review?

  * 🙋 All developers, no matter how their intentions, are prone to errors. It's best to have at least one person look first.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Evr_Git-Collaboration/README.md`.

### 11. Everyone Do: Git Collaboration (20 min)

* Open the [GitHub guide on collaboration flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) in your browser and explain the following:

  * When working on an application with other developers, establishing a workflow that everyone agrees on is crucial to the project's success.

  * This typical workflow consists of each developer creating their own branches to work on separate parts of the application, pushing that branch up and opening a pull request, reviewing that pull request, and ultimately merging the updated code into `main`.

  * Communication around a project is as important than the actual code being written. No developer should be able to autonomously make decisions that affect the product without the input and review of the other developers. 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Evr_Git-Collaboration/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* If time allows, set up this demonstration yourself with other instructional staff or students as collaborators and walk through the guide to demonstrate the following: 

  * When we want to start work on a new feature, we create a new branch to do our work in:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/awesome-feature

  # or like this...
  git branch feature/awesome-feature
  git checkout feature/awesome-feature
  ```

  * We do our work and we commit and push our branch, then open a pull request and add our collaborators as reviewers. Since we protected the `main` branch, we need someone else to review and merge for us.

  * The reviewers now have to fetch and checkout the pull request's branch to test and confirm that the code is okay to be merged. If not, leave comments on the pull request and request changes.

  * When the pull request is merged to `main`, everyone should get their local branches in sync so all updated code is in place.

* Explain that the Git and GitHub workflow is not an exact science and it's okay if merge conflicts or errors happen every once in a while. The key to smooth development processes is communication and cooperation amongst collaborators.

* Answer any questions before students go on break.

### 12. BREAK (40 min)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini Project (5 min) 

* Open `27-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we search for information from the Library of Congress API, we see our results on another page.

  * 🔑 We can fine tune our search by adding a format the Library of Congress API understands.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 Using all of the skills we've learned so far! 

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini Project (60 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Unit 06 Mini Project: Library of Congress Search Tool

  In this activity, you will work with a group to build an application that searches and displays results from the Library of Congress API.

  ## Instructions

  * The completed application should meet the following criteria:

    * As a user, I can submit a search query from the application to request data and receive a response from the Library of Congress.

    * As a user, I can either perform a generic search for data in all formats or I can select a format in the form to help filter results.

    * As a user, I can see all of the results of my search displayed on a separate page.

    * As a user, I can conduct additional searches from the results page as well.

  * To learn about how to use this API, check out the Requests section of the [Library of Congress API documentation.](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/)

  ### The Home Page

  * The home page (`index.html`) should have the following:

    * A simple, well thought out UI.

    * A form with a text input field to capture a search query and an option select dropdown to capture the format of the search query. The options in the dropdown should be a list of the possible format values listed in the [Library of Congress API docs.](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html#format)

    * A browser event listener attached to the form to execute a function upon submission, which will capture both form values and redirect the user to a search results page with those values included in the URL as query parameters. This will use the browser's `location.replace()` method.

    * If there is no format selected from the dropdown, the URL should look something like this:

      ```http
      /search-results.html?q=dogs&format=
      ```

    * If there is a format selected from the dropdown, the URL should look something like this instead:

      ```http
      /search-results.html?q=dogs&format=photos
      ```

  ### The Search Results Page

  * The search results page (`search-results.html`) should have and do the following:

    * On page load, if there are query parameters, immediately parse them and use them in a request URL to fetch data from the Library of Congress API.

    * If there is a value for the format query parameter, use the [format endpoint](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html#format) to search for something based on the chosen format.

    * If there is no value for the format query parameter, use the [search endpoint](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html#search) to search for all types of data.

    * The response from the API request will then be displayed on the page. It is up to your and your team to determine what data is important to be displayed from [the overall response object,](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/responses.html) but you must use data from the `results` property in the response object.

    * The same form from the home page should be here as well. Instead of redirecting a user to another page, however, it will perform a search right on the page and display the new results.

  ## Assets

  * Here is a mockup of what the home page can look like:

    ![The home page shows a search bar with the ability to select a format from a dropdown menu.](./Images/01-homepage.png)

  * Here is a mockup of what the search results page can look like:

    ![The search results page displays results from a search conducted in the form on the left side of the page.](./Images/02-search-results-page.png)

  ---

  ## 💡 Hints

  * Will every result have the same data? If no, how will we handle printing it to the page?

  * Can the form design and functionality from the home page be reused for the search results page?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  * Use your new Git collaboration knowledge to build this project!

  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini Project  (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ The Library of Congress API docs

  * ✔️ Passing params from page to page

  * ✔️ Reuse search functionality

* Open `https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/requests.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We can see exactly how to use this API through their documentation. This way we can study how to create a request to multiple endpoints depending on if there's a format or not.

* Open `https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/responses.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We also must study what data returns from the API so we can determine what should or shouldn't be displayed on the page.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 Upon form submission, we gather the form inputs and use them as search parameters on the "search results" page:

    ```js
    var queryString = './search-results.html?q=' + searchInputVal + '&format=' + formatInputVal;

    location.assign(queryString);
    ```

  * We use `location.assign()` so we can maintain correct functionality of the "Back" button in the browser, which wouldn't be the case if we were to use `location.replace()`.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Main/assets/js/display-search.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 On page load, we execute the `getParams()` function to retrieve the search params from URL and use them for a `fetch()` request:

    ```js
    function getParams() {
      var searchParamsArr = document.location.search.split('&');

      var query = searchParamsArr[0].split('=').pop();
      var format = searchParamsArr[1].split('=').pop();

      searchApi(query, format);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We want search functionality to occur on this page as well, so we reuse the functionality from `script.js` in `display-search.js`:

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What happens if a search returns with no entries?

  * 🙋 We print a message to the screen informing the user so they don't think something's wrong.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Introduce Homework (5 min)

* Open `02-Homework/Main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * We are going to build a weather application that gives us a 5-day forecast.

  * Our previous searches also get added to the left column so we can quickly search again.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are we learning?

  * 🙋 How to build applications that use external data.
