# 06.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to Fetch continued

## Overview 

* The majority of activities today continue off using fetch with the GitHub API. You will also be introducing the Chrome DevTools Network Activity tab, the response object and document.location web API method.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_Network_Activity` through `20-Stu_Documentation_Location`

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have. Take a few moments before class to get familiar with the [Response documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) and [Network Activity Tab](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network).

* Throughout the class remind the students that this will get easier as they gain familiarity with the GitHub API documentation and using Fetch.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Utilize the Chrome DevTools Network Activity Tab.

* Implement and utilize the Response Object from a fetch request.

* Implement deconstructed parameters in an API request URL.

* Implement fetch options for a fetch request.

* Utilize document location to replace the URL in the browser.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Inform the students that we will be building upon the previous days activities and will be continuing to use the Fetch API.

* Explain that in this class we will build upon the previous day's exercises by learning how to create complex fetch requests.  We will also learn about some options available to help us debug fetch requests.

* Ask the students the following question:

  * ☝️ When something goes wrong with a `fetch` request, how do we find out what the issue was?

  * 🙋 We can use the `Response Object` and the Chrome DevTools `Network Activity Tab` to help us find out what went wrong.

  * ☝️ When trying to debug a problem, what would be a good step towards solving it?

  * 🙋 We could use search engines like Google, tech forums like StackOverflow, or even do some rubber ducky debugging!

* Open [Response Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response) in your browser and scroll to properties, then explain the following:

  * When we make a fetch request, we receive a response object back. That object contains methods that allow us to parse out particular pieces of data.
  
* Click on the `Response.status` property, and scroll down to the coded example.

  ```js
  var myImage = document.querySelector('img');

  var myRequest = new Request('flowers.jpg');

  fetch(myRequest).then(function(response) {
    console.log(response.status); // returns 200
    response.blob().then(function(myBlob) {
        var objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(myBlob);
        myImage.src = objectURL;
    });
  });
  ```

  * We can use the `response.status` method to receive a `status code`.

  * HTTP response `status codes` are able to tell us whether a request was a success or failure.

* Ask the students the following question:

  * ☝️ How can we learn more about the Response object and status codes?

  * 🙋 We can visit the documentation!
  
### 2. Instructor Demo: Network Activity Tab (5 mins) 

* Open `11-Ins_Network_Activity/index.html` in your browser to the network activity tab and demonstrate the following.

  * 🔑 Press `command/ctrl R` to record the reload.

  * 🔑 The Network Activity tab records the loading of local and remote resources.

  * 🔑 The status codes indicate whether these resources came through successfully or not.

  * 🔑 Status codes will quickly let us know what happened with a particular request.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is the Network Activity tab useful for?

  * 🙋 It allows us to track requests and resources to and from our applications.

  * ☝️ How do we learn about using the Network Activity Tab.

  * 🙋 The Chrome DevTools documentation.

* Reiterate that whenever we use a new library, framework, or technology, it's best we familiarize ourselves with the documentation as much as possible.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to Slack the instruction text to the students in their class-specific channel.

### 3. Student Do: Network Activity Tab (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Network_Activity/index.html`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# 🐛 Error Appears in the Chrome DevTools Network Activity Tab

## 💡 Hints

* How are JavaScript files usually loaded by an HTML page?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other features are available in the Chrome DevTools Network Activity tab?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Network Activity Tab (10 mins)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with using the `Network Activity Tab`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Use the network activity tab.

  * ✔️ Look at the status codes.

  * ✔️ Debug your code based on that information.

* Open in the browser to the network activity tab. After doing so, press `command/ctrl R ` to record the reload and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We examine the status of codes of the resources in the activity tab.

  * 🔑 Red status codes indicate that there is an error.

    * Mention that after debugging, the script.js file now has a status code of 200.

* Open `12-Stu_Network_Activity/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We can see the `src` URL was originally incorrect.

  ```html
  <script src="./script.js"></script>
  ```

  * If we change the `src` to the correct relative path, it works!

  ```html
  <script src="./assets/js/script.js"></script>
  ```

  * 🔑 After correcting the error we can go back to the `Network Activity Tab` to check if the corrections work.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we find out if something went wrong with the resources in the `Network Activity Tab`?

  * 🙋 By checking the status code for each resource.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 Read the [Network Activity Tab docs](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network) and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Fetch Status (5 mins)

* Open `13-Ins_Fetch_Status/index.html` in the browser to the network activity tab. After doing so, press `command/ctrl R ` to record the reload and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 The status for the fetch request is listed with the value of 200.

  * 🔑 This confirms that the fetch request is successful.

* Open `13-Ins_Fetch_Status/asset/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We check to see if the `response.status` equals 200.
  
  ```js
    .then(function (response) {
    if (response.status === 200){
  ```

  * 🔑 If it does, we assign the status code from `response.status` to the `textContent`.

  ```js
  responseText.textContent = response.status;
  ```

  * 🔑 Finally, we return `response.json()`.

  ```js
  return response.json();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we learn more about using the `Response Object`?

  * 🙋 We read the documentation.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Fetch_Status`.

### 6. Student Do: Fetch Status (15 mins)

  * 🔑 We check if the `response.status` does not equal 200.

  ```js
  .then(function (response) {
    if (response.status !== 200) {
  ```

  * 🔑 We assign the `textContext` to be equal to the `response.status`.

  ```js
  responseText.textContent = response.status;
  ```

  * 🔑 We still return `response.json()` as fetch will try to resolve the response most of the time.  

  ```js
  return response.json();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why are status codes useful?

  * 🙋 Knowing the status codes of responses and working with them is vital to creating a good user experience.

  * 🔑 We can find these parameters in the APIs documentation.

* Open `15-Ins_Deconstruct_Parameters/assets/script/js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We attached multiple parameters after `?` in the URL.

  ```js
  fetch('https://api.github.com/gists/public?since=2020-06-01&per_page=100')
  ```

  * 🔑 Each parameter offers a specific filter, `since` filters for a start from date.

  ```js
  ?since=2020-06-01
  ```

  * 🔑 We use the `&` symbol to chain the parameters together.

  ```js
  ?since=2020-06-01&per_page=100
  ```

  * 🔑 `per_page` filters the number of results returned. While the default value is 30, here we specify 100.

  ```js
  &per_page=100
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):
