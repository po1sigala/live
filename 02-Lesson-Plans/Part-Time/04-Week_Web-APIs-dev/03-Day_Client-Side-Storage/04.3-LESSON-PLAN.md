# 04.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Client Side Storage 

## Overview 

In today's lesson, the class will delve further into storing data locally within the user's browser using local storage. Students will also work together to build a timer mini-project that reinforces the DOM manipulation and Web API skills covered this week. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `XX-Ins_Demo-Title` through `XX-Stu_Activity-Title`.

* In the activities and the mini-project, students will be required to apply the DOM manipulation skills they learned in this week. Encourage the students to look back on previous activities to refresh their memory and for help with syntax, if needed. 

* Be ready to view and edit local storage  key-value pairs in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to [View And Edit Local Storage With Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/localstorage).

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Store data in the user's browser using local storage.

* Explain when client side storage is the right solution.

* {TODO One more}

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Remind the students that DOM manipulation and Web API skills are powerful tools that allow developers to build fully interactive web apps but they can also be tricky for those new to programming.

* Reassure students that during today's class there will be plenty of time to practice the skills covered during the week to help develop and hone their DOM manipulation skills.

* Inform the students that today's class they will also learn a new, dependable DOM tool that will allow them to do something new with their web pages: store data right in the browser. 

* Open `26-Stu_Local-Storage-Todos/Solved/index.html` in your browser and point out the following to students:

  * When we enter a `todo` into the text box, a new HTML element is created.

  * When we click on the button, the `todo` disappears. 

  * When we close the brower tab and re-open it, the added `todo` is still there.

* Note that previously, when we closed a browser, the data did not persist. That is because there was no way for the page to 'remember' data. 

* Local storage is a property of the `window object` that allows us to store data in the browers and use it on our page even after the browser window is closed. 

* Ask the class the following question(s):

  * ☝️ What is the `window object`?

  * 🙋 The `window object` represents an open browser window. The `window object` has its own methods and properties. 
 
* The local storage property allows us to store data right in the window object.  So when a page is closed, the data can be stored until the page is re-opened or it is retrieved. 

* By using local storage we can 'remember' bits of information like a user's log-in information, preferences to help make pages more user-friendly and interactive. 

* Using local storage is also just another application of DOM manipulation and Web APIs.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Local Storage (5 min)

* Open `21-Ins_Local-Storage/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We click on the buttons to increase and decrease the number of hours coded.

  * 🔑 When we refresh the page, the number of hours does not reset as we might expect. Instead, the last number of hours is 'remembered' and is displayed.

* Open Chrome DevTools and click the Application tab to open the Application panel to view local storage.

  * 🔑 The count is stored as a key-value pair in the browser's local storage. When we increase or decrease the count by clicking the button, the value stored in local storage changes too.

* Open `19-Ins_Local-Storage/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we click on a button, we add the click count to storage using the local storage method `.setItem()`. 

  * 🔑 Set item takes a key-value pair. The first is the name we use to refer to the stored data. The second is the value. Since we want to store the current count in local storage, we give it a key of `count` and set it to the value of the current count.

  ```js
  localStorage.setItem("count", count);
  ```

  * 🔑 To retrieve the count, we use local storage's `getItem()` method. 

  ```js
  var  count = localStorage.getItem("count");
  ```

  * 🔑 We display the retrieved count in HTML using the `.textContent` property.

  ```js
  counter.textContent = count;
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

* ☝️ How can we save key-value pairs in our browser and retrieve them to use in our code?

* 🙋 We use local storage. We use `setItem()` to set a key-value pair and `.getItem()` to retrieve it.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Local-Storage/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Local Storage (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Local-Storage/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement Local Storage for Sign-Up Form

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to save the email and password to localStorage and render the last submission to the page.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when `Last Registered User: ` displays the last email and password saved to local storage, if it exists.

  * It's done when the `signUpButton` is clicked, the email and password entered into the text boxes is saved to local storage and the information under `Last Registered User: ` is updated.

  ## Assets

  The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

  ![Mockup](./images/01-screenshot.png)

  ## 💡 Hints

  What methods do we use to set and get items to local storage?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Does local storage have an expiration date? What happens when the browser is closed?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Local Storage (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

* ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with local storage? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help! 

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `localStorage.getItem()`

  * ✔️ `localStorage.setItem()`

* Open `22-Stu_Local-Storage/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We use `querySelector()` to select our DOM elements and assign them to variables.

  ```js
  var  emailInput = document.querySelector("#email");
  var  passwordInput = document.querySelector("#password");
  var  signUpButton = document.querySelector("#sign-up");
  var  msgDiv = document.querySelector("#msg");
  var  userEmailSpan = document.querySelector("#user-email");
  var  userPasswordSpan = document.querySelector("#user-password");
  ```

  * 🔑 In the `renderLastRegistered()` function, we query `localStorage` using the `getItem()` method for both `email` and `password` strings.

  ```js
  function  renderLastRegistered() {
  var  email = localStorage.getItem('email');
  var  password = localStorage.getItem('password');
  ```

  * If either `email` or `password` are null, our function returns. Otherwise, we render the values using the `textContent` property in the `userEmailSpan` and `userPasswordSpan` elements, respectively.

  ```js
  if (email === null || password === null) {
  return;
  }

  userEmailSpan.textContent = email;
  userPasswordSpan.textContent = password;
  ```

  * We use `addEventListener()` on our `signUpButton` and listen for a `click`event. We prevent the browser's default action using `event.preventDefault()`.

  ```js
  signUpButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  ```

  * We use `querySelector()` and the `value` property to assign the values in the form fields to `email` and `password` variables.

  ```js
  var email = document.querySelector('#email').value;
  var password = document.querySelector('#password').value;
  ```

  * 🔑 We store the values in `localStorage` using the `setItem()` method and call the `renderLastRegistered()` method. If the `email` or `password` strings are empty, we display an error message. Otherwise, we display a message indicated the registration is successful.

  ```js
  if (email === "") {
    displayMessage("error", "Email cannot be blank");
    } else  if (password === "") {
      displayMessage("error", "Password cannot be blank");
    } else {
      displayMessage("success", "Registered successfully");
      localStorage.setItem("email", email);
      localStorage.setItem("password", password);
      renderLastRegistered();
    };
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where is the data stored in local storage stored?

  * 🙋 Values stored in `localStorage` are stored locally in the user's browser as key-value pairs.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

  

* Answer any questions before ending the class.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Local Storage Objects (5 min) 

* Open `23-Ins_Local-Storage-Objects/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We often want to store data that is related together. To do that, we can use an object. 

  * 🔑 When we select a student's name, grade and make a comment, the information is saved.

* Open Chrome DevTools and click the Application tab to open the Application panel to view local storage.

  * 🔑 When we open Chrome DevTools, we can see that the the student's name, grade and comment are stored together in single key-value pair. 

* Open `23-Ins_Local-Storage-Objects/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When the button is clicked, we store the current values as an object. 

  ```js
  var studentGrade = {
    student: student.value,
    grade: grade.value,
    comment: comment.value.trim()
  };
  ```

* 🔑 If we tried to store the object directly in local storage, we would get an error. So we use the `JSON.stringify()` method to convert the object into a string.

  ```js
  JSON.stringify(studentGrade)
  ```

* 🔑 The string can then be stored as a key-value pair in local storage using the `setItem()` method.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we store a group of related data in local storage?

  * 🙋 We can use an object. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Local-Storage-Objects/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do:  (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Local-Storage-Objects/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Save Object in Local Storage

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to save the information from a form as an object in local storage.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I click on the `save` button and the form's current values are stored in a object.

  * It's done when the object is saved as a single key-value pair in local storage. 

  ## 💡 Hints

  What JSON method can you use to return a string? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What is JSON? How is it useful for sending and storing data?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
