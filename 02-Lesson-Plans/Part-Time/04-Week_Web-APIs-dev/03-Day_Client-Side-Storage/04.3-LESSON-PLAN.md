# 04.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Client Side Storage 

## Overview 

In today's lesson, the class will delve further into storing data locally within the user's browser using local storage. Students will also work together to build a timer mini-project that reinforces the DOM manipulation and Web API skills covered this week. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `XX-Ins_Demo-Title` through `XX-Stu_Activity-Title`.

* In the activities and the mini-project, students will be required to apply the DOM manipulation skills they learned in this week. Encourage the students to look back on previous activities to refresh their memory and for help with syntax, if needed. 

* Be ready to view and edit local storage  key-value pairs in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to [View And Edit Local Storage With Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/localstorage).

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Store data in the user's browser using local storage.

* Explain when client side storage is the right solution.

* {TODO One more}

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* DOM manipulation and Web API skills are powerful tools that allow developers to build fully interactive web apps. But they can also be tricky at first!

* Reassure students that during today's class their will be plenty of time to practice the skills covered during the week to help develop and hone their skills

* Inform the students that they will also be  

* Open the deployed [ToDo list](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/fs-ground-04-web-APIs-todo-demo/index.html) in your browser and point out the following to students:

  * When we enter a `todo` into the text box, a new HTML element is created.

  * When we click on the button, the `todo` disappears. 

  * We can close the browser tab and reopen the application and have our TODOs still there. 

* All of this is possible because of DOM manipulation and Web APIs. 

* Note that in the last class, we learned one way to use Web APIs to store data so that it would persist even after the browser window was close or refreshed. 

* Ask the class the following question(s):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where was the data actually stored when we use local storage? 

  * üôã The data was stored in the browser.

  

* When we store the data locally on the user's machine, we refer it as client-side storage. 


 
* Use student answers to transition to the first activity of the day.
