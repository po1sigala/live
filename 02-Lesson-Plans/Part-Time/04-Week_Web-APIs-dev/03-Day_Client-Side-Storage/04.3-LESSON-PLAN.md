# 04.3 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Client-Side Storage 

## Overview 

In today's lesson, the class will delve further into storing data locally within the user's browser using client-side storage. Students will also work together to build a timer mini-project that reinforces the DOM manipulation and Web API skills covered this week. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `21-Ins_Local-Storage` through `28-Stu_Timer-App`.

* In the activities and the mini-project, students will be required to apply the DOM manipulation skills they learned in this week. Encourage the students to look back on previous activities to refresh their memory and for help with syntax, as needed. 

* Be ready to view and edit `localStorage` key-value pairs in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to [View And Edit Local Storage With Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/localstorage).

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Store data in the user's browser using `localStorage`.

* Implement JSON methods to convert an object to and from a JSON string.

* Use client-side storage to persist data

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Remind the students that DOM manipulation and Web API skills are powerful tools that allow developers to build fully interactive web apps but they can also be tricky for those new to programming.

* Reassure students that during today's class there will be plenty of time to practice the skills covered during the week to help them develop and further hone their DOM manipulation skills.

* Inform the students that today's class they will also learn a new, useful DOM tool that will allow them to do something new with their web pages: client-side storage.

* Open `26-Stu_Local-Storage-Todos/Solved/index.html` in your browser and point out the following to students:

  * When we enter a `todo` into the text box, a new HTML element is created.

  * When we click on the button, the `todo` disappears. 

  * When we close the browser tab and re-open it, the added `todo` is still there.

* Note that previously, when we closed a browser window, the data did not persist. That is because the data is not automatically saved between page loads.

* To store data so that it persists, we use use client-side storage. 
 
* Client-side storage is a Web API that allows us to store information directly on the client, or the user's browser.

* With client-side storage, we can 'remember' bits of information like a user's log-in information and preferences to help make pages more personalized and interactive. 

* The syntax to store data right in the user's browser is also simple to use. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Local Storage (5 min)

* Open `21-Ins_Local-Storage/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  *  We click on the buttons to increase and decrease the number of hours coded.

  * 🔑 When we refresh the page, the number of hours does not reset. Instead, the data persists. This is client-side storage at work. 

* Open Chrome DevTools and click the Application tab to open the Application panel to view local storage.

  * 🔑 The count is stored as a key-value pair in the browser using `LocalStorage`.  When we increase or decrease the count by clicking the button, the stored value changes too.

* Open `19-Ins_Local-Storage/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we click on a button, we add the number of clicks to storage using the window's `localStorage` property and use the method `.setItem()` to add a key-value pair to storage. 

  ```js
  localStorage.setItem("count", count);
  ```

  * 🔑 To retrieve the count, we use the `.getItem()` method. This will get the value saved in storage and save it to the variable `count`. 

  ```js
  var  count = localStorage.getItem("count");
  ```

  * 🔑 We render the retrieved count in HTML using the `.textContent` property.

  ```js
  counter.textContent = count;
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

* ☝️ How can we save key-value pairs in our browser and retrieve them to use in our code?

* 🙋 We use the `localStorage` property. The method `.setItem()` is used set a key-value pair in storage and `.getItem()` to retrieve it.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Local-Storage/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Local Storage (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_Local-Storage/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement Client-Side Storage for Sign-Up Form Using localStorage

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to save the email and password to client-side storage and render the last submission to the page.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when `Last Registered User: ` displays the last email and password saved using `localStorage`, if it exists.

  * It's done when the `signUpButton` is clicked, the email and password entered into the text boxes is saved using `localStorage`.

  * It's done when the information under `Last Registered User: ` is updated to reflect the data stored using `localStorage`.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Local Storage (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

* ☝️ How comfortable do you feel using `localStorage`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help! 

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `localStorage.getItem()`

  * ✔️ `localStorage.setItem()`

* Open `22-Stu_Local-Storage/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We use `querySelector()` to select our DOM elements and assign them to variables.

  ```js
  var  emailInput = document.querySelector("#email");
  var  passwordInput = document.querySelector("#password");
  var  signUpButton = document.querySelector("#sign-up");
  var  msgDiv = document.querySelector("#msg");
  var  userEmailSpan = document.querySelector("#user-email");
  var  userPasswordSpan = document.querySelector("#user-password");
  ```

  * 🔑 In the `renderLastRegistered()` function, we query `localStorage` using the `getItem()` method for both `email` and `password` strings.

  ```js
  function  renderLastRegistered() {
  var  email = localStorage.getItem('email');
  var  password = localStorage.getItem('password');
  ```

  * If either `email` or `password` are null, we exit the function with `return`. Otherwise, we render the values using the `textContent` property in the `userEmailSpan` and `userPasswordSpan` elements, respectively.

  ```js
  if (email === null || password === null) {
  return;
  }

  userEmailSpan.textContent = email;
  userPasswordSpan.textContent = password;
  ```

  * We use `addEventListener()` on our `signUpButton` and listen for a `click` event. We prevent the browser's default action using `event.preventDefault()`.

  ```js
  signUpButton.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  ```

  * We use `querySelector()` and the `value` property to assign the values in the form fields to `email` and `password` variables.

  ```js
  var email = document.querySelector('#email').value;
  var password = document.querySelector('#password').value;
  ```

  * 🔑 We store the values in `localStorage` using the `setItem()` method and call the `renderLastRegistered()` method. If the `email` or `password` strings are empty, we display an error message. Otherwise, we display a message indicated the registration is successful.

  ```js
  if (email === "") {
    displayMessage("error", "Email cannot be blank");
    } else  if (password === "") {
      displayMessage("error", "Password cannot be blank");
    } else {
      displayMessage("success", "Registered successfully");
      localStorage.setItem("email", email);
      localStorage.setItem("password", password);
      renderLastRegistered();
    };
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Where is the data stored in `localStorage` stored?

  * 🙋 Values stored in `localStorage` are stored locally in the user's browser as key-value pairs.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Local Storage Objects (5 min) 

* Open `23-Ins_Local-Storage-Objects/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We often want to store related data together. 

  * When we select a student's name and grade and make a comment, the information is saved.

  * 🔑 To preserve the relationship between related data, we can use an object. 

* Open Chrome DevTools and click the Application tab to open the Application panel to view local storage.

  * 🔑 When we open Chrome DevTools, we can see that the the student's name, grade, and comment are stored together in single key-value pair. 

* Open `23-Ins_Local-Storage-Objects/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When the button is clicked, we store the current values together as an object.

  ```js
  var studentGrade = {
    student: student.value,
    grade: grade.value,
    comment: comment.value.trim()
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 We cannot store an object directly using `localStorage`. So we use the `JSON.stringify()` method to convert the object into a string.

  ```js
  JSON.stringify(studentGrade)
  ```

* 🔑 The string can then be stored as a key-value pair in local storage using the `setItem()` method.

  ```js
  localStorage.setItem("studentGrade", JSON.stringify(studentGrade));
  ```

* Finally, we call a helper function `renderMessage`.

  ```js
  function renderMessage() {...}
  ```

* 🔑 Inside the helper function, we retrieve the string and convert it back into an object with `JSON.parse()`. If `lastGrade` is not null, we display a message for the user.

  ```js
  function renderMessage() {
    var lastGrade = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("studentGrade"));
    if (lastGrade !== null) {
      document.querySelector(".message").textContent = lastGrade.student + 
      " received a/an " + lastGrade.grade
    }
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we store a group of related data using `localStorage`?

  * 🙋 We can use an object and then convert it to a string using `JSON.stringify()` to be stored.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Local-Storage-Objects/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Local Storage Objects (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Local-Storage-Objects/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  # 📖 Save Object Using localStorage

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to save the information from a form as an object using `localStorage`.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I click on the `save` button and the form's current values are stored in a object.

  * It's done when the object is saved as a string using `localStorage`.

  ## 📝 Notes
  
  Refer to the documentation:

### 7. Instructor Review: Local Storage Objects (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with storing objects using `localStorage`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `JSON.stringify()`

  * ✔️ `.setItem()`

* Open `24-Stu_Local-Storage-Objects/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We add a click event to the `signUpButton` element and use `event.preventDefault()` to cancel the browser's default form action. 

  ```js
  signUpButton.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  ```

  * When the button is clicked, we store the current values of the form in an object. We use the string method `.trim()` to eliminate any whitespace and leave only the text. 

  ```js
   var user = {
    firstName: firstNameInput.value.trim(),
    lastName: lastNameInput.value.trim(),
    email: emailInput.value.trim(),
    password: passwordInput.value.trim()
  };
  ```

  * 🔑 We use the JSON method `JSON.stringify()` to turn the object into a string.

  ```js
  JSON.stringify(user)
  ```

  * 🔑 We use `.setItem()` to store the stringified object using `localStorage`.

  ```js
  localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When we want to store an object using `localStorage`, what extra step do we have to take? 

  * 🙋 We stringify the object using `JSON.stringify()` because the value we store in `localStorage` needs to be a string.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Local Storage Todos (5 min) 

* Open `25-Ins_Local-Storage-Todos/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we re-open a browser, the data that was last stored using `localStorage` appears on the page.

  * 🔑 This data appears because data has been saved to `localStorage`, the existing data has been retrieved, and the data has been rendered to the page when the page loads. 

* Open `25-Ins_Local-Storage-Todos/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We use a function to hold the code to retrieve and render the data. This makes the code block easily reused.

  ```js
  function renderLastGrade() {
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Inside the `renderLastGrade()` function, we use the method `.getItem()` to retrieve the data from storage. The data is retrieved as a string.

  ```js
  localStorage.getItem("studentGrade")
  ```

  * 🔑 Since the return data is stringified, we use the JSON method `JSON.parse()` to convert it back into an object. We then store the object in a variable so we can use it in our code. 

  ```js
  var lastGrade = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("studentGrade"));
  ```

  * 🔑 If data is returned from storage, we use `.innerHTML` to render the data to the page. 

  * 🔑 Else if `null` is returned, we use `return` to exit out of the function.

  ```js
  if (lastGrade !== null) {
    document.getElementById("saved-name").innerHTML = lastGrade.student;
    document.getElementById("saved-grade").innerHTML = lastGrade.grade;
    document.getElementById("saved-comment").innerHTML = lastGrade.comment;
  } else {
    return
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We want the data retrieved and rendered when we load the page. So, we put it in a function called `init()` that holds the code we want executed when the page first loads and then call the function. If data has previously been saved using `localStorage`, the data will appear on the page. 

  ```js
  function init() {
    renderLastGrade();
  }

  init();
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do we need to do to get stored data to appear on our page when we open a browser window?  

  * 🙋 We retrieve the data using `.getItem()` and then render it to the page using DOM manipulation. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Local-Storage-Todos/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Local Storage Todos (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Local-Storage-Todos/README.md`.

### 10. Instructor Review: Local Storage Todos (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with implementing `localStorage` in an app? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `JSON.stringify()`

  * ✔️ `JSON.parse()`

  * ✔️ `init()`

* Open `26-Stu_Local-Storage-Todos/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  *  We add an event listener to the todo form so that when a user enters a todo item, the data is stored on `submit`. The todos are stored and rendered using two helper functions, `storeTodos()` and `renderTodos()`.

  ```js
  todoForm.addEventListener("submit", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    var todoText = todoInput.value.trim();
      if (todoText === "") {
        return;
      }
    todos.push(todoText);
    todoInput.value = "";
    storeTodos();
    renderTodos();
  });
  ```

  * 🔑 The `storeTodos` function stores an array using `localStorage`. First, we stringify it using `JSON.stringify()`, then we set it to storage using `.setItem()`. 
  
  * We need to save todo items to `localStorage` in a few places, so storing this action in the function `storeTodos` cleans up our code!

  ```js
  function storeTodos() {
    localStorage.setItem("todos", JSON.stringify(todos));
  }
  ```

  *  🔑 We've stored the todo items, but we also need to be able to retrieve the data from storage. We will do this inside the `init` function.

  *  🔑 `init()` is being invoked in `script.js`, so it will run every time the page loads.
  
  * 🔑 Inside of `init()` we use `.getItem()` and convert the data from a string to an array using `JSON.parse()`. To use the array in our code, we store it in a variable.

  ```js
  function init() {
    var storedTodos = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("todos"));
    if (storedTodos !== null) {
      todos = storedTodos;
    }
    renderTodos();
  }
  ```

  * We have stored todo items in local storage and parsed them using JSON methods. Now we need to render each item. We will do this with the `renderTodos` function.

  * We use `.createElement()` and `.appendChild()` to render our todo list. Since we are going to reuse this code, we store it in a function, just like we did with `storeTodos()`.

  ```js
  function renderTodos() {
  todoList.innerHTML = "";
  todoCountSpan.textContent = todos.length;

    for (var i = 0; i < todos.length; i++) {
      var todo = todos[i];

      var li = document.createElement("li");
      li.textContent = todo;
      li.setAttribute("data-index", i);

      var button = document.createElement("button");
      button.textContent = "Complete ✔️";

      li.appendChild(button);
      todoList.appendChild(li);
    }
  }
  ```

  * Finally, we need to add an event listener to the `completed` button so that a user can remove todo items. We do this by using the `"data-index"` of the `button`'s parent element to remove the correct todo item from the `todos` array.
  
  * We call the `storeTodos()` and `renderTodos()` functions when the `complete` button is clicked to store and render the updated list. 

  ```js
  todoList.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
    var element = event.target;
    if (element.matches("button") === true) {
      var index = element.parentElement.getAttribute("data-index");
      todos.splice(index, 1);
      storeTodos();
      renderTodos();
    }
  });
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we use `localStorage` to store information in our own apps?

  * 🙋 We set the information as a key-pair using `.setItem()` and retrieve it using `getItem()`. To show the stored information on our page when a browser page is refreshed, we use a function that retrieves the stored data if it exists and using DOM manipulation to render it to our page. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Using the Web Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Pull-Request/README.md`. 

### 11. Everyone Do: Git (20 min)

  * A pull request is a tool that allows us to collaborate and comment on code before it is merged to the main branch. 

  *  In this activity, we'll practice creating a new repository on Github, pulling down the repo to our local machine using `git clone`, and pushing up changes using `git push`. We will also explore pull requests by opening a pull request, reviewing the request, and merging the changes into the main branch.

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Pull-Request/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

* Open your browser and navigate to [Github](https://github.com/) and demonstrate the following:

  * We create a new repository by clicking on the `new` button and initializing the repo with a `README.md`. 

* Open your terminal and demonstrate the following:

### 12. BREAK (40 min)

### 13. Instructor Demo: Mini Project (5 min) 

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/main/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we open the browser, if the user's previous win-loss history is displayed.

  * 🔑 When we click on the start button, blanks appear on the screen. Each blank represents a letter in the word to be guessed.

  * 🔑 When we click on the start button, the timer starts.

  * 🔑 When the user guesses the word, the timer stops and a win message is displayed.

  * 🔑 When time runs out and the user has not guessed the word, a lose message appears.

  * 🔑 The user's wins and losses appear on the screen. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We use `localStorage` to save the user's wins and losses. We use the `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` methods to create a timer. We use DOM manipulation methods to update the screen. To add words to the screen we can use an array and array methods. 

* Answer any questions before allowing students to start the mini project.

### 14. Student Do: Mini Project (60 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `28-Stu_Mini-Project/README.md`.

* Break your students into groups that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Unit 04 Mini-Project: Word Guess

  In this activity, you will work with a group to build a game using JavaScript and Web APIs.

  ## Instructions

  The completed application should meet the following criteria:

  * As a user, I want to start the game by clicking on a button. 

  * As a user, I want to try and guess a word by filling in a number of blanks that match the number of letters in that word.

  * As a user, I want the game to be timed. 

  * As a user, I want to win the game when I have guessed all the letters in the word.

  * As a user, I want to lose the game when the timer runs out before I have guessed all the letters.

  * As a user, I want to see my total wins and losses on the screen. 

  ### Specifications

  * When a user presses down on a letter key, the user's guess should be captured as a key event.

  * When a user correctly guesses a letter, the corresponding blank `_` should be replaced by the letter. For example, if the user correctly selects `a`, then `a _ _ a _ ` should appear. 

  * When a user wins or loses a game, a message should appear and the timer should stop. 

  * When a user clicks the start button, the timer should reset. 

  * When a user refreshes or returns to the browser page, the win and loss counts should persist.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: Mini Project  (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with this mini-project? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `getItem()`

  * ✔️ `setItem()`

  * ✔️ `addEventListener()`

  * ✔️ `setInterval()`

  * ✔️ `clearInterval()`

   * ✔️ `keydown`

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 
 
  * We store the words the user will guess in an array.

  ```js
  var words = ["variable","array", "modulus", "object", "function", "string", "boolean"];
  ```

  * The actions that will be performed are organized into a series of functions. Each function holds a block of code that performs a task and is called when needed to execute, often inside another function.  This allows us to write DRY-er code and make our code blocks more reusable.

  * We use an `init` function to hold the code we want to execute when the page loads. When the `init` function executes, the functions called inside it will also execute. 

  ```js
  function init() {
    getWins();
    getlosses();
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 The `getWins` function retrieves the win count from storage using `.getItem()` and renders it to the page.

  ```js
  function getWins() {
    var storedWins = localStorage.getItem("winCount");
    if (storedWins === null) {
      winCounter = 0;
    } else {
      winCounter = storedWins;
  }
  win.textContent = winCounter;
}

* The `getlosses` function also retrieves the loss count from storage and renders it to the page. If no data ia returned, the lose counter is set to `0`.

```js
function getlosses() {
  var storedLosses = localStorage.getItem("loseCount");
  if (storedLosses === null) {
    loseCounter = 0;
  } else {
    loseCounter = storedLosses;
  }
  lose.textContent = loseCounter;
}
```

* 🔑 To set the data to storage, we use `.setItem()`. We put the code in the functions  `setWins` and `setLosses`. These functions will be called inside the `winGame` and `loseGame` functions.

```js
function setWins() {
  win.textContent = winCounter;
  localStorage.setItem("winCount", winCounter);
}

function setLosses() {
  lose.textContent = loseCounter;
  localStorage.setItem("loseCount", loseCounter);
}
```

* 🔑 To start the game when the button is clicked, we add an event listener to the start button.

```js
startButton.addEventListener("click", startGame);
```

* The `startGame` function executes when the button is clicked. `renderBlanks` and `startTimer` will also be executed.

```js
function startGame() {
  isWin = false;
  timerCount = 10;
  startButton.disabled = true;
  renderBlanks()
  startTimer()
}
```

* The `renderBlanks` function uses `Math.random()` to randomly pick a word from an array and a loop to push blanks to the `blankLetters` array.

```js
function renderBlanks() {
  chosenWord = words[Math.floor(Math.random() * words.length)];
  lettersInChosenWord = chosenWord.split("");
  numBlanks = lettersInChosenWord.length;
  blanksLetters = []
  for (var i = 0; i < numBlanks; i++) {
    blanksLetters.push("_");
  }
  wordBlank.textContent = blanksLetters.join(" ")
}

```

* 🔑 The `startTimer` function starts the countdown. We use `setInterval()` to set the count to decrease each second and `clearInterval()` to stop the countdown. The `startTimer` function also uses conditionals to determine if the user won or lost.

```js
function startTimer() {
  timer = setInterval(function() {
    timerCount--;
    timerElement.textContent = timerCount;
    if (timerCount >= 0) {
      if (isWin && timerCount > 0) {
        clearInterval(timer);
        winGame();
      }
    }
    if (timerCount === 0) {
      clearInterval(timer);
      loseGame();
    }
  }, 1000);
}

```

* The `winGame` and `loseGame` functions are executed if the win and loss conditions are met. Note that the `setWins` and `setLosses` function are called inside the function. This will set the data to storage.

```js
function winGame() {
  wordBlank.textContent = "YOU WON!!!🏆 ";
  winCounter++
  startButton.disabled = false;
  setWins()
}

function loseGame() {
  wordBlank.textContent = "GAME OVER";
  loseCounter++
  startButton.disabled = false;
  setLosses()
}

```

* 🔑  To capture the user's input, we attach an event listener to the document and use a `keydown` event. If the timer count is zero, then the function returns and nothing happens. Else, we check that the inputted key is a letter and if it is, the `checkLetters` and `checkWins` function is executed.

```js
document.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
  if (timerCount === 0) {
    return;
  }
  var key = event.key.toLowerCase();
  var alphabetNumericCharacters = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789 ".split("");
  if (alphabetNumericCharacters.includes(key)) {
    var letterGuessed = event.key;
    checkLetters(letterGuessed)
    checkWin();
  }
});
```

* In the `checkLetters` function, we use conditional statements to test if the letter is a match. 

```js
function checkLetters(letter) {
  var letterInWord = false;
  for (var i = 0; i < numBlanks; i++) {
    if (chosenWord[i] === letter) {
      letterInWord = true;
    }
  }
  if (letterInWord) {
    for (var j = 0; j < numBlanks; j++) {
      if (chosenWord[j] === letter) {
        blanksLetters[j] = letter;
      }
    }
    wordBlank.textContent = blanksLetters.join(" ");
  }
}

```

* We also use conditional statements to check if there is a win.

```js
function checkWin() {
  if (chosenWord === blanksLetters.join("")) {
    isWin = true;
  }
}
```

* For the bonus, we use `querySelector() to select the reset button element.

```js
var resetButton = document.querySelector(".reset-button");
```

* We create a function  called `resetGame`.

```js
function resetGame() {}
````

* Inside the function, we reset the values of the win and lose counters to `0`.

```js
winCounter = 0;
loseCounter = 0;
```

* We call the `setWin` and `setLosses` function inside `resetGame`. When, the `resetGame` function is called, the values will be reset to `0` then saved to storage. The order is important here.

```js
function resetGame() {
  winCounter = 0;
  loseCounter = 0;
  setWins()
  setLosses()
}
```

* We use an event listener to execute the `resetGame` function when the button  is clicked.

```js
function resetGame() {
  winCounter = 0;
  loseCounter = 0;
  setWins()
  setLosses()
}
```
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When working to solve a complex coding problem like the Mini-Project, it is important to have a plan. How can you use functions to break your complex projects down into manageable chunks of code? 

  * 🙋 Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a task. We can write a function to perform a simple task needed in our code. Then, we can call it when we need it even inside another function. 

  * ☝️ How can we use event listeners to capture user input and perform a task? 

  * 🙋 We attach an event listener to the HTML element like a button or even the entire document. When the event occurs, a function will be executed. For example, we attach an event listener to a button to listen for a click. When a click happens, the actions decribed in the function will occur. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Event Listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener), [MDN Web Docs on Window.localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage), [MDN Web Docs on WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval) and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
