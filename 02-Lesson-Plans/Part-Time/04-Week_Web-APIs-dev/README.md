# Unit 04 Instructor Overview: Web APIs 

## Overview

In this unit, students will be introduced to the Document Object Model and gain experience using Web APIs to manipulate the DOM. Students will also handle click events using `.addEventListener()`, work with keyboard events such as `keyup` and `keydown`, and gain experience using local and session storage.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Remind students to do a git pull of the class repo before every class and to have that day's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* This week's homework will bring together the key concepts convered in the activities and require students to use both intervals and local storage. The students will also need to research and use Web APIs not introduced in the activities. To set the students up for success, explain that the methods used in class are just a sampling of a few of the many methods available to manipulate the DOM.

* Be ready to view and edit local storage and session storage key-value pairs in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to [View And Edit Local Storage With Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/localstorage) and [View And Edit Local Storage With Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/sessionstorage)

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

Students may come across jQuery solutions when searching for DOM and event resources. Make sure to let them know that we will cover jQuery in the next unit, so for now, do not consult resources that include the word `jQuery` or the `$` variable.
