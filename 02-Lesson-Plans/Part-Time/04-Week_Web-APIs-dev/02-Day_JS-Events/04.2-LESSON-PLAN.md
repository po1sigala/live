# 4.2 Lesson Plan - Event Listeners

## Overview

In today's class, students will learn to add event listeners to a DOM element, cancel default events, and stop event propogation. Students will also use the Window's local storage property to store data locally in the browser. 

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `11-Ins_Click-Event` through `20-Stu_Local-Storage`.

* Today's class is focused on providing students with additional exposure to the DOM, this time focusing on events. The primary focus of today should be to ensure that students feel comfortable setting up event listeners and using their callbacks to manipulate the DOM.

* Be ready to view and edit local storage key-value pairs in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to [View And Edit Local Storage With Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/localstorage).

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

* By the end of class students will be able to:

  * Handle click events using `.addEventListener()`

  * Prevent default behavior with `event.preventDefault()`.

  * Stop the propagation of events using `event.stopPropagation()`

  * Work with keyboard events `keyup` and `keydown`

  * Store values using `localStorage`

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Congratulate the class on how much they've learned up to this point and stress that while mastering DOM manipulation  may seem tricky at first, it is an essential skill for any developer who wants to build fully interactive web applications.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are some ways we have already learned to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript?

  * 🙋 We have learned to create and append elements to the document, use `setAttribute()` to add styles to specific elements, and implement timers using `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`.

* Explain that in today's class we are going to build on our DOM skills by learning how to use JavaScript to react to a user or browser action. These actions are called events. 

* Open the [Event Target Example](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/events/useful-eventtarget.html) in your browser and explain the following:

  * The MDN Web Docs team built this demo to showcase how an event -- in this case a click -- can trigger a JavaScript reaction.

  * When we open the browser, we see a red block.

  * When we click on an area inside block, the area we clicked changes to a new color.

  * When we click on the area again, the color changes to a different color.

* Note that we have already learned most of the skills needed to achieve this color change reaction. 

* We can use `setAttribute()` or the element's `.style` property to add or change an element's color.

* We can use the document methods `.querySelector()` or `.getElementbyId()` to access the element we want to change.

* Explain that in today's class, we will practice the skills from last class and learn how to attach a method to an HTML element that listens for an event and then reacts by executing a block of code.

### 2. Instructor Demo: Event Listener (5 min) 

* Open `Ins_Event-Listener/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑  When we open the browser window, the background is in dark mode.

  * 🔑  When we click on the toggle switch, the background switches to light mode.

  * 🔑  When we click on the toggle switch again, the background returns to dark mode.

* Open `Ins_Event-Listener/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑  We add the `.addEventListener()` method to the toggle switch element to listen for an event.

  ```js
  themeSwitcher.addEventListener()
  ```

   * 🔑 The `.addEventListener()` method takes two parameters. The first is the type of event. We set that to `click` since we want something to happen when a user clicks on the toggle switch.

   ```js
   themeSwitcher.addEventListener("click",
   ```

   * 🔑 The second parameter is the action that we want performed when a user clicks. It is a function.

   ```js
   themeSwitcher.addEventListener("click", function() {
   ```

  * 🔑 If the mode is dark when a user clicks, we use `.setAttribute()` to change the background to a light color.

  ```js
  if (mode === "dark") {
    mode = "light";
    container.setAttribute("class", "light");
  }
  ```

 * 🔑 Else when a user clicks, we set the background to a dark color by setting the class `dark`.

 ```js
  else {
    mode = "dark";
    container.setAttribute("class", "dark");
  } 
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

 * ☝️ Where have we used conditional statements before?

  * 🙋 We used conditional statements to add decision making to our Rock, Paper, Scissors project. In fact, all the code used to perform the triggered action is code we learned before. Using the `.addEventListener()` is just adding a new layer to our JavaScript skills.

  * ☝️ The `.addEventListener()` needs two parameters to execute. What are the two parameters?

  * 🙋 The `.addEventListener()` method takes the name of the event such as "click" as the first parameter the action that will be executed as the second parameter.  

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Event-Listener/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Event Listener (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_Event-Listener/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🏗️ Implement Event Handler When User Clicks on Button

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to increment or decrement a count when a user clicks on a button.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a user clicks on the increment button and the count is increased by `1`.

* It's done when a user clicks on the decrement button and if the count is greater than `0`, the count is decreased by `1`.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![Mockup](./images/01-demo.gif)

## 💡 Hints

What two parameters does the document method `.addEventListener()` take? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* A `click` is just one type of DOM event. What are some others?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Event Listener (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with event listeners? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `.querySelector()`

  * ✔️ `.addEventListener()`

* Open `12-Stu_Event-Listener/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use `.querySelector()` to select the button elements. 

  ```js
  var incrementEl = document.querySelector("#increment");
  var decrementEl = document.querySelector("#decrement");
  ```

  * 🔑 We use `.addEventListener()` and set the type of event to be a `click`.

  ```js
  incrementEl.addEventListener("click", function() {
  ```

  * 🔑 We add the action we want executed as the `.addEventListener()` method's second parameter. This function increments the count by `1` and  calls the `setCounterText()` function to update the HTML. 

  ```js
  function() {
    count++;
    setCounterText();
  }
  ```

  * We repeat the process for the decrement button except use the decrement operator `--` to decrease the count. We add a conditional statement so the action is performed only if the count is greater than `0`.

  ```js
  decrementEl.addEventListener("click", function() {
    if (count > 0) {
      count--;
      setCounterText();
    }
  });
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can we listen for an event on an HTML element and then react by performing an action?

  * 🙋 We use the document method `.addEventListener()`. We set the method's first parameter to the type of event we want to listen for and the second parameter is the action we want performed when an event, like a click, happens.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on EventTarget.addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Prevent Default (5 min) 

* Open `13-Ins/Preventing-Default/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* 🔑 When we enter information and click on the submit button on this form, a message appears.

* 🔑 The message includes the information that we entered in the text fields and the text fields are not cleared.

* Open `13-Ins/Preventing-Default/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Sometimes, we want to prevent a default action from occurring in response to an event.

  * 🔑 When we click on button inside a `<form>` element, the information in all text fields is cleared out by default.

  * 🔑 To prevent that action from happening, we use `event.preventDefault()`. This allows us to retain the information inputted to the text field after the click so we can print the message.

  ```js
  function showResponse(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    console.log(event);
    var response = "Thank you for your submission " + nameInput.value + "! We will reach out to you at " + emailInput.value + ".";
    submissionResponseEl.textContent = response;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 The action we want peformed when a user clicks on an element can also be separated into its own, named function. We add it as the second parameter of the `.addEventListener()` method by using the name of function.

  ```js
  submitEl.addEventListener("click", showResponse);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we prevent a default action from occurring when an event fires?

  * 🙋 We use `event.preventDefault()`. This is useful when we click on an submit button in a form. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Prevent-Default/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Prevent Default (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Prevent-Default/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

# 🐛 Submit Button on Form Returns 404 Error

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should be able to see the calculated tip amount and total on the screen after clicking on the submit button. 

## Expected Behavior

When a user enters numbers in the text fields and clicks on the `Calculate Tip` button, calculated totals for both the tip amount and total should appear on screen.  

## Actual Behavior

When a user clicks on the `Calculate Tip` button, a 404: ENOENT error appears. 

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![Mockup](./images/01-screenshot.png)

---
## 💡 Hints

What action may be preventing the calculated totals from being rendered correctly on the page? How can we cancel that action?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Even when an event is canceled, it continues to propogate. What does that mean? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: Prevent Default (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with preventing default actions? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `.addEventListener()`

  * ✔️ `event.preventDefault()`

* Open `14-Stu_Prevent-Default/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * When we click the submit button, some actions are automatically performed by the browser by default. This can cause unwanted behavior or errors. 

  * 🔑 To fix this, we add a line of code to the action we want to have performed when we click. In this case, the `.addEventListener()` is used to set up the `addTip` function to be executed when the button is clicked.

  ```js
  submitEl.addEventListener("click", addTip);
  ```

  * 🔑 Inside the `addTip` function, we add `event.preventDefault()` to the top of the code block. This will stop the browser from clearing the information in the text fields by default.

  ```js
  function addTip(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    var tipPercentage = tipEl.value * .01;
    var total = totalEl.value;
    var tipAmount = calculateTip(total, tipPercentage);
    var newTotal = calculateTotal(tipAmount, total);
    document.querySelector("#tip-amount").textContent = tipAmount;
    document.querySelector("#new-total").textContent = newTotal.toFixed(2);
  }

* Open `14-Stu_Prevent-Default/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

* When we test our app, we see that the when we stopped the browser from executing the default behavior using `event.preventDefault()`, the app now executes as expected. The error is gone.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we stop default browser actions?

  * 🙋 We use `event.preventDefault()` to stop the default behavior. This can be useful for blocking unwanted default behavior in our code.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Event.preventDefault()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Keyboard Events (5 min) 

* Open `15-Ins_Keyboard-Events/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * A click is just one type of event we can use to trigger an action.

  * When we change the font type from `serif` to `monospace`, the font of the page is changed.

  * When we push down on a letter key in the text box, the letter that is pushed is displayed.

* Open `15-Ins_Keyboard-Events/assets/js/script.js` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We attach a `change` event to the `<select>` element using `.addEventListener()`. When the user selects a value from a <select>'s dropdown, the function will execute. 

  ```js
  typefaceEl.addEventListener("change", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    typeface = typefaceEl.value;
    document.querySelector(".container").style.fontFamily = typeface;
  });
  ```

  * 🔑 We attach a keyboard event to the `<textarea>` element using `.addEventListener()`. A `keydown` event is fired when a key is pressed down.
  ```js
  textAreaEl.addEventListener("keydown", function(event) {
  ```

  * 🔑 Keyboard events have two commonly used properties. The `key` property returns the value of the key pressed. The `code` property returns the key's code. We use `event.key` to access the value of the pressed key. 

  ```js
  var key = event.key.toLowerCase();
  ```

  * 🔑 We use `.textContent` to set the content of an element to the pressed key's value.

  ```js
  element.textContent += event.key;
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do we access the value of a pressed key?

  * 🙋 We use the event object's properties. Two commonly used properties are `key` and `code`. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Keyboard-Events/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Keyboard-Events/README.md`.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Keyboard Events (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with keyboard events? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `event.key`

  * ✔️ `event.code`

  * ✔️ `.textContent`

  * ✔️ `.addEventListener()`

   * ✔️ `keydown`

* Open `16-Stu_Keyboard-Events/Solved/assets/js/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We use the `key` property to access the value of the pressed key and store it in a variable.

  ```js
  var keyPress = event.key;
  ```

  * 🔑 We use the `code` property to access the key's code.
  ```js
  var keyCode = event.code;
  ```

  * 🔑 We display the pressed key, key code and status on the page by setting the elements content using `.textContent`.

  ```js
  document.querySelector("#key").textContent = keyPress;
  document.querySelector("#code").textContent = keyCode;
  document.querySelector("#status").textContent = "KEYDOWN Event";
  ```

  * We attach an `addEventListener()` method to the `document` and set the first parameter to `keydown`. This will fire the event with the key is pressed down. This is different than `keyup` which is fired when the key is released.

  ```js
  document.addEventListener("keydown", keydownAction);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How are keyboard events useful in our code? 

  * 🙋 Keyboard events react to user input on the keyboard. This can be used in many ways. In some games, pressing a specific key causes something to happen. Other times, a developer may ask a user to press a certain key to go to another page or execute some function on the screen.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on KeyboardEvent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Event Bubbling (5 min) 

* Open `17-Ins_Event-Bubbling/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we click on the outer box, the color changes to purple.

  * 🔑 When we click on the inner box, the color changes to orange.

  * 🔑 When we click on the nested button, the button turns blue.

  * 🔑 When we refresh the page, and click on the button first, all the colors change.

* Open `17-Ins_Event-Bubbling/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 Event bubbling happens by default in JavaScript. That means when an event happens the event will traverse up the DOM tree and can create a chain reaction of events.

  * 🔑 In our HTML, the button is nested inside the orange box which is nested inside the purple box. So, when we click on the button, the event will travel up the DOM tree.

  ```html
   <div>
    <h2>Event Bubbling </h2>
    <div class="outer-div">CLICK TO TURN ME PURPLE
      <div class="inner-div">CLICK TO TURN ME ORANGE
        <div>
          <button class="button">CLICK TO TURN ME BLUE</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  ```
* Open `17-Ins_Event-Bubbling/assets/js/script.js` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 When we click on the button, the button turns blue.

 ```js
 function changeBlue(event) {
  event.currentTarget.setAttribute(
    "style",
    "background-color: blue"
  );
}
```

  * 🔑 The click event also travels up the DOM. Since the orange box is also listening for a click, the color changes too. The same with the the purple box.

```js
outer.addEventListener("click", changePurple);
inner.addEventListener("click", changeOrange);
button.addEventListener("click", changeBlue);
```

 * 🔑 To stop this from happening, we use `event.stopPropagation()`.  When we add the method at the top of functions that change the color, the event bubbling stops.

```js
event.stopPropagation();
```
* Open `17-Ins_Event-Bubbling/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 When we click on the boxes or the nested button, only that element changes color. 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do we need to do to stop event bubbling?

  * 🙋 When an event occurs, it traverses up the DOM tree by default. To stop that action from happening, we use event.`stopPropagation()`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `19-Stu_Event-Bubbling/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: Event Bubbling (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `19-Stu_Event-Bubbling/README.md`.

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `carousel.querySelector()`

  * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We select the buttons using their parent carousel element. 

    ```js
    var next = carousel.querySelector(".next");
    var prev = carousel.querySelector(".prev");
    ```

  *  When we click on the carousel, a new window opens up that displays the image. 

   ```js
   carousel.addEventListener("click", function() {
    window.location.href = images[index];
   });
   ```

  * 🔑 The buttons also have an event listener attached. To prevent the click from bubbling up to the parent carousel and causing a new window to open, we use `event.stopPropagation()`

  ```js
  next.addEventListener("click", function(event) 
  event.stopPropagation();
  navigate(1);
  });
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is event bubbling in a nutshell?  

  * 🙋 By default, events bubble up the DOM tree from the innermost HTML element. That means if we click on a nested button, it is like we clicked on the parent element too. To prevent this default action, we use `event.stopPropagation()` so that the event will no longer travel up the DOM tree. 

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs Intro to Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events), [MDN Web Docs on Event.stopPropagation()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation) and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Local Storage (5 min) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * 🔑 @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, HOW? } 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

### 16. Student Do: { ACTIVITY NAME } (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `@TODO/folder/file`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
@TODO ADD INSTRUCTIONS
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: Event Bubbling(15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with event bubbling? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `window.location.href`

  * ✔️ @TODO { THAT }

  * ✔️ @TODO { THE OTHER }

* Open `@TODO/f` in your IDE and explain the following: 

   * When the image is clicked, we use `window.location.href` to navigate the browser to the url that hosts the image. This opens up a new window.

    ```js
    carousel.addEventListener("click", function() {
      window.location.href = images[index];
    });
    ```

  * 🔑 We do not want the
