# 7.1 Lesson Plan - Github Collaboration & Project Week (6:30 PM)

## Overview

Today's class introduces Project 1 and Agile software development.

## Instructor Notes

* ‚ùó Determine project groups prior to class. Create groups of 3 or 4 students. Three is ideal, but not always possible. In groups of four (or more), it is easy for weaker students to be cut out of the workflow or hide behind their stronger teammates. **DO NOT allow students to work alone or in pairs.** Group projects are one of the few opportunities for students to work collaboratively. 

* If students complain about group configurations, remind them of the following:

  * In the real-world, you don't get to choose your co-workers

  * Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer

* üìù Students will be allowed to form their own groups for the final project. 

* The first XX minutes of class are lecture on agile software development. Students then break into groups to brainstorm ideas and prepare user stories and wireframes. Use the time after break to meet with each team to discuss their idea and course correct as you see fit. 


## Learning Objectives

    * **Agile software development**: Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change. @TODO rewrite this Wikipedia quote 

  * **What is iterative development?**:

  * **What is a MVP?**:

  * **Minimum Viable Product**: A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.
