# 07.1 Lesson Plan: Project Week(s) (6:30 PM)

## Overview

Today's class introduces Project 1 and Agile software development.

## Instructor Notes

* ‚ùó Determine project groups prior to class. Create groups of 3 or 4 students. Three is ideal, but not always possible. In groups of four (or more), it is easy for weaker students to be cut out of the workflow or hide behind their stronger teammates. **DO NOT allow students to work alone or in pairs.** Group projects are one of the few opportunities for students to work collaboratively. 

* If students complain about group configurations, remind them of the following:

  * In the real-world, you don't get to choose your co-workers

  * Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer

* üìù Students will be allowed to form their own groups for the final project. 

* The first XX minutes of class are lecture on agile software development. Students then break into groups to brainstorm ideas and prepare user stories and wireframes. Use the time after break to meet with each team to discuss their idea and course correct as you see fit. 

* ‚ùó Two in-class demonstrations ask you to use an existing GitHub repository. You can create one on-the-fly or you may want to create on in advance.


## Learning Objectives

* Explain agile software development 

* Explain minimum viable product (MVP) in relation to agile

* Create Issues on GitHub

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Agile (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the slide deck and follow these prompts with their corresponding slides:

    * **What is a project?**: We're about to begin our first project. But first, what is a project?

    * **Projects**: A project is "any undertaking, carried out individually or collaboratively and possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned (usually by a project team) to achieve a particular aim." [Wikipedia: Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project)

    * **How do we carefully plan a project?**: 

    * **Project management**: the practice of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria at the specified time. The primary challenge of project management is to achieve all of the project goals within the given constraints. [Wikipedia: Project management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management)

    * **What is the definition of agile?**: In general, what does it mean to be _agile_?

    * **agile [ aj-uhl, -ahyl ]**: According to dictionary.com, agile is "quick and well-coordinated in movement". 

    * **What is agile software development?**: What do we think "agile" means in terms of software development?

    * **Agile software development**: Agile software development is an iterative approach to developing software. Teams deliver value to their customers faster by working incrementally rather than working towards a big launch. Teams improve and respond to change by continuously evaluating project plans, requirements and user needs. 

    
    * **What is iterative development?**: What is _iteration_? If iteration is the repetition of a process in order to generate a sequence of outcomes, what is _iterative development_? 

    * **Iterative Development**: In an iterative approach to development, working software is the primary measure of progress. Our goal is to build functional applications, even if they are very simple, like a skateboard. If we set out to build a sports car, we may never get there and we will have unhappy customers along the way.

    * **What is an MVP?**: It's not _most valuable player_.

    * **Minimum Viable Product**: A minimum viable product is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. [Wikipedia: MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)

    * **How do we determine an MVP?**: How do we know what our minimum viable product is?

    * **Determining a Minimum Viable Product**: There are a lot of approaches to defining a minimum viable product, but we can simplify it to three questions: 1) who is your audience?; 2) what is the problem that the product will address?; 3) how does the product solve that problem?

    * **What is a user story?**: 

    * **User stories**: In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language description of one or more features of a software system. User stories are often written from the perspective of an end user or user of a system. [Wikipedia: User story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story)

    * **What is acceptance criteria?**: 

    * **Acceptance criteria**: Acceptance criteria define the boundaries of a user story and are used to confirm when a story is completed and working as intended. [Wikipedia: Acceptance criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story#Acceptance_criteria)

    * **What is an Issue?**:

    * **Issues**: Use issues to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.

### 2. Instructor Do: Demo GitHub Issues (5 min)

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Creating an Issue on GitHub

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Writing a user story 

* Navigate to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) in your browser and explain the following point(s):

    * When we open a project repository, we see next to the `Code` tab an `Issues` tab. 
    
    * If we navigate to the `Issues` tab, we will see any open Issues.

    * If we click the green `New Issue` button, we are routed to a form where we can create a new issue. 

    * When we create an Issue, we want to give it a descriptive and accurate title: 

    ```md
    See referral traffic for inbound analysis
    ```

    ```md
    AS A marketing analyst
    I WANT to see referral traffic
    SO THAT I can adapt strategy to convert more leads
    ```

    * We also want to add acceptance criteria: 

    ```md
    GIVEN I am an authenticated user
    WHEN I request a range of referral traffic 
    THEN a chart is generated
    ```

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO 

    * üôã @TODO 


### 3. Student Do: User Stories and Issues (5 mins)

@TODO direct students to follow slide prompt to write a user story for a mock persona then share with class


### 4. Instructor Do: Agile, Continued (5 mins)

* Open the slide deck and follow these prompts with their corresponding slides:

    * **What is kanban?**:

    * **Kanban**: Kanban is a project management tool that visualizes work through cards representing User Stories or Issues. In their simplest form, Kanban boards are broken into three columns: To Do; In Progress; Done. Cards begin in the To Do column and are moved from left to right as work is started and completed.


### 5. Instructor Do: GitHub Projects (5 mins)

* Use the prompts and talking points below to demonstrate the following key point(s):

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Creating a Project on GitHub

    * ‚úîÔ∏è Adding Issues to a Project

@TODO instructor demonstrates creating a project and adding the GitHub Issue create above

* Ask the class the following question(s) and call on students for the corresponding answer(s):

    * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO 

    * üôã @TODO 

### 6. Student Do: GitHub Projects (5 mins)

@TODO direct students to follow slide prompt to create a project then share with class


### 7. Instructor Do: Agile, Continued (10 mins)

* Open the slide deck and follow these prompts with their corresponding slides:

    * **What is daily scrum?**: 

    * **Stand-up Meetings**: Stand-up meetings are used to hold teams accountable to each other. Team members make commitments to work on aspects of the project and report out progress. Stand-up meetings are useful in identifying issues as they arise and developing plans to resolve them. There are generally three questions each team member answers in a stand-up: 1) What was accomplished?; 2) What are your goals?; 3) Are there any obstacles to achieving your goals? [Wikipedia: Stand-up meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)

    * **Project Timeline**:

    * **Get Professional**:

    * **Application Requirements**:

    * **Presentation Requirements**:
