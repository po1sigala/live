# 02.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Advanced CSS

## Overview 

The theme of today's class is overwriting browser defaults. Students will implement a CSS reset to zero out certain styles and then rebuild those styles using advanced CSS concepts like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_CSS-Resets` through `20-Stu_Custom-Forms`

* Skim over the [MDN web docs on pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements), and [adjacent sibling combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator) to get familiar with some of the advanced CSS selectors that students will be using.

* Today's lesson also touches on typography. Students will likely see different fonts on their Windows and macOS machines, so be prepared to discuss web-safe fonts and font fallbacks.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain why you would use a CSS reset

* Use typographical CSS properties like `font-family` and `line-height`

* Add pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to HTML elements

* Explain the default styles that browsers apply to form elements

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Ask students the following question:

  * ☝️ What new CSS tricks have you learned this week?

  * 🙋 Media queries, flexbox, box shadows, rounded corners, etc.

* Explain that a big part of CSS is undoing, or re-styling, the default styles that the browser gives you. This is especially true for form elements, which are ubiquitous across the web but not as easy to customize as `<div>` and `<span>` containers.

* Open the [Postcard Form Example](https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/postcard-example/) in your browser and explain the following:

  * The MDN web docs team built this form as an example of what's possible with CSS.

  * The `<textarea>`, `<input>`, and `<button>` elements have all been customized.

* Ask students the following question:

  * ☝️ What CSS properties do you recognize as being used in this example?

  * 🙋 `transform`, `border-radius`, `background`, etc.

* Open the Chrome DevTools and delete the `<style>` element to remove all of the styles on the page.

* Explain that this is how the form was originally styled by the browser. In today's class, we'll look at additional CSS properties that will help us rebuild our own forms.

### 2. Instructor Demo: CSS Resets (5 mins) 

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * 🔑 This page has no style sheet, but the browser already renders elements a certain way.

  * 🔑 Every browser renders these defaults differently, which can cause unwanted discrepancies.

  * Developers find it helpful to reset these defaults before applying their own styles, allowing them to write CSS with peace of mind.

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Let's add a style sheet that resets these defaults by uncommenting the `<link>` element.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/reset.css" />
    ```

  * In the browser, all of the margins, padding, and font sizes have been normalized. Now a developer can rebuild these styles from scratch exactly the way they want.

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/assets/css/reset.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We use a wildcard selector to reset the box size of every element.

    ```css
    * {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    ```

  * We give the `<html>` element a `height` of `100%` and the `<body>` a `min-height` of `100%` to ensure the document always takes up at least the size of the viewport. This makes it easier to position things like footers.

    ```css
    html {
      height: 100%;
    }

    body {
      min-height: 100%;
      line-height: 1;
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
    ```

  * Several HTML elements like `<input>` and `<button>` have their own font styling, so we reset them to match the rest of the page.

    ```css
    input, select, option, optgroup, textarea, button,
    pre, code {
      font-size: 100%;
      font-family: inherit;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why would you want to reset the browser's default CSS?

  * 🙋 To give yourself a clean starting point, to minimize cross-browser differences

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_CSS-Resets`.

### 3. Student Do: CSS Resets (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_CSS-Resets`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Fix the CSS Reset

  In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug a broken webpage to better explain how a CSS reset works.

  ## Instructions

  * Be sure to work with your partner!

  * Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the page's styles. Note that they currently do not meet the following requirements:

    * As a user, I expect headings to be a larger font size

    * As a user, I expect spacing in between the lines of text

  * To meet these requirements, the page should look like the following image:

    ![The blog layout has larger sized headers and spacing in between the lines of text](./Images/01-correct-styles.png)

  * Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
    
    * What do the DevTools reveal about the CSS rules being applied?
    
    * What do the style sheets in the [assets/css folder](./Unsolved/assets/css/) have in common?
    
    * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

  ## 💡 Hint(s)

  * You won't need to write any new CSS rules to fix the styling on this page.

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    * What is Normalize.css and how does it affect different browsers?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: CSS Resets (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with using CSS resets? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Order of precedence

  * ✔️ Selector specificity

* Open `12-Stu_CSS-Resets/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We needed to swap the `<link>` elements, so the `reset.css` style sheet loads first.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/reset.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
    ```

  * 🔑 When style sheets have conflicting CSS rules, like a generic `h1` selector, the style sheet that's loaded second will take precedence.

* Open `12-Stu_CSS-Resets/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * The CSS rules for `<ul>` elements didn't conflict, because the selectors in `style.css` were more specific. For example, a `<ul>` inside of a `<nav>` element.

    ```css
    nav ul {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      min-width: 300px;
    }

    article ul {
      margin-left: 5%;
      font-size: 110%;
      list-style: circle;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 A more specific selector will always take precedence over a generic selector, regardless of style sheet order.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What other CSS rules conflicted in the two style sheets?

  * 🙋 They both have a rule for `body`

  * ☝️ Why would you always want to load your CSS reset first?

  * 🙋 To avoid undoing your custom styles

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 5. Instructor Demo: Typography (5 mins) 

* Open `13-Ins_Typography/index.html` in your browser. Inspect the `<p class="one">` element with the Chrome DevTools to explain the following:

  * The class has a `font-family` value of `'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif`.
  
  * 🔑 Multiple fonts are listed in case the user's operating system can't find the first or second one. Helvetica, for instance, is usually not installed on Windows machines.

  * 🔑 The `font-weight` and `font-style` properties can make a font appear bold or slanted, but by how much depends on the font being used. `oblique`, for instance, will often look the same as `italic`.

* Inspect the `<p class="four">` element with the Chrome DevTools to demonstrate the following:

  * Setting the `text-transform` property to `uppercase` or `capitalize` will change how the text is capitalized.

  * Setting the `text-decoration` property to `underline` or `line-through` will apply a line to the text.

  * 🔑 There are many ways to alter a font with CSS, but making a font look good usually comes down to adjusting the `margin`, `line-height`, and `font-size`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why should you provide more than one `font-family` value?

  * 🙋 Not every computer will have the first font specified

  * ☝️ How do you know which font properties are available to use?

  * 🙋 Read the [MDN web docs on fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) or experiment with the Chrome DevTools

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Typography`.

### 6. Student Do: Typography (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Typography`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Typography

  In this activity, you will work with a partner to use CSS documentation to apply typographic properties to text to make the blog more readable after a CSS reset.

  ## Instructions

  * Be sure to work with your partner!

  * Navigate to the [Fundamental text and font styling article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals) in your browser.

  * Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the text on the page.

    * We are given a blog with all of the default styles reset. The layout has been rebuilt, but the text still needs more work!

  * Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE and examine the code.

  * Using the CSS documentation, implement the following:

    * As a user, I want to view my body font as the default standard size of 16px.

    * When I read paragraphs, it should have a line height of 1.5 times the font height.

    * When I view the headings, it should be 150-200% of the font size and have a font family of serif.

    * When I view the page, there should be a margin of 2-5% on the heading, paragraph, and list.

    * When I see lists, it should be indented, have square bullet points and a font family of monospace.

  * The result should look like the following image:

    ![The blog page includes a monospaced list and headings with a serif font](./Images/01-CSS-typography.png)

  * Add a few personal touches to the text! Play around with the `font-style` and `font-weight` to make the text slant and bold.

  ## 💡 Hint(s)

  * Working with CSS should be a creative experience for you! Your end product should look as close to the solution as possible, but feel free to try out other looks!

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    * What are some other options for web fonts besides the given basic fonts?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: Typography (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with CSS fonts? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Default fonts

  * ✔️ Font percentages

* Open `14-Stu_Typography/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We adjusted the `body` CSS rule to include a base `line-height` and `font-size`.

    ```css
    body {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      line-height: 1.5;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We added margins to the headers, set the `font-size` to be a percentage of the base font, and set the `font-family` to the operating system's default `serif` font.

    ```css
    h1 {
      margin: 2%;
      font-size: 200%;
      font-family: serif;
    }

    h2 {
      margin: 3% 0;
      font-size: 180%;
      font-family: serif;
    }

    h3 {
      font-size: 150%;
      font-family: serif;
    }
    ```

  * We adjusted the list element's left margin, set the `list-style` to be `square`, and changed the `font-family` to the default `monospace` font.

    ```css
    article ul {
      margin-left: 5%;
      list-style: square;
      font-family: monospace;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What CSS properties can you use to alter a font?

  * 🙋 `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `text-decoration`, etc.

  * ☝️ Why is using a percentage for font sizes helpful?

  * 🙋 We only need to change the base font size to scale other elements accordingly.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Pseudo-Classes (5 mins) 

* Open `15-Ins_Pseudo-Classes/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 With CSS, we can style the different states that an element can be in.

  * When you move the cursor over a button, it's in a **hover** state.

  * When you actively press the mouse down on a button, it's in an **active** state.

  * When you've clicked on or tabbed into a button, it's in a **focus** state.

* Open `15-Ins_Pseudo-Classes/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 In CSS, we use pseudo-classes like `:hover` to capture these different states.

    ```css
    button:hover {
      background-color: #772014;
      color: #fff;
    }
    ```

  * In the `:focus` pseudo-class, we set the `outline` property to `none` to remove the browser's default highlight border.

    ```css
    button:focus {
      outline: none;
      border-color: #8ac4ff;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What do pseudo-classes allow you to do?

  * 🙋 Style the different states of an element

  * ☝️ What are some of the states you could style?

  * 🙋 Hover, active, focus, etc.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes`.

### 9. Student Do: Pseudo-Classes (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Pseudo-Classes

  In this activity, you will work with a partner to apply pseudo-classes to elements to enhance the UI.

  ## Instructions

  * Be sure to work with your partner!

  * Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the page.

  * Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the CSS code.

  * Using HTML and CSS, implement the following features:

    * As a user, I want additional resource links at the bottom of the article.

    * When the page loads, the resource links should initially be hidden.

    * When I move the mouse over the text "Show Resources," the resource links should display.

  * To meet these requirements, the page should look like the following image by default:

    ![The text "Show Resources" appears at the bottom of the article](./Images/01-resources-closed.png)

  * When the cursor is over the "Show Resources" text, the page should look like the following:

    ![Three links to the MDN web docs appear under the text "Show Resources"](./Images/02-resources-open.png)

  * You can use the following resource links for the content:

    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design

    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries

    * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox

  ## 💡 Hint(s)

  * You will need to use the CSS `display` property.

  * Look up examples of how other developers used the `:hover` pseudo-class in creative ways.

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    * How can you force pseudo-class styles to display using the Chrome DevTools?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Pseudo-Classes (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with pseudo-classes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `:hover` pseudo-class

  * ✔️ `display: none` vs `display: block`

* Open `16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We added `<h3>` and `<ul>` elements inside of the resources `<div>`.

    ```html
    <div class="resources">
      <h3>
        Show Resources
      </h3>
      <ul class="links">
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design">MDN web docs on responsive design</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries">MDN web docs on using media queries</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox">MDN web docs on flexbox</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    ```

* Open `16-Stu_Pseudo-Classes/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We initially set the `<ul>` element to `display: none` to remove it from the document flow.

    ```css
    .resources .links {
      display: none;
      padding: 1% 0;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 When the parent `.resources` element is in a hover state, we change the `display` of the child `.links` element to `block`. This returns it to the document flow, but only while the parent is in its hover state.

    ```css
    .resources:hover .links {
      display: block;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ When is an element in a hover state?

  * 🙋 When the mouse cursor is inside of that element

  * ☝️ What elements can have a `:hover` pseudo-class added to them?

  * 🙋 All the elements!

  * ☝️ What does `display: none` do to an element?

  * 🙋 It removes the element from the document flow

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) and [display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Pseudo-Elements (5 mins) 

* Open `17-Ins_Psuedo-Elements/index.html` in your browser. Inspect the `<h1>` element with the Chrome DevTools to demonstrate the following:

  * The only text in the `<h1>` element is "CSS".

  * 🔑 An `::after` pseudo-element has been added with CSS to insert extra content after the original content.

    ```css
    h1::after {
      font-family: Impact;
      content: 'Pseudo Elements';
      color: #8ac4ff;
      margin-left: 5px;
    }
    ```

* Inspect one of the `<h3>` elements with the Chrome DevTools to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 A `::before` pseudo-element has been added with CSS to insert extra content before the original content.

    ```css
    h3::before {
      font-family: Impact;
      content: '\273A';
      color: #772014;
      margin-right: 5px;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What are these pseudo-elements doing?

  * 🙋 Inserting extra content before or after the original content

  * ☝️ How do pseudo-elements differ from pseudo-classes?

  * 🙋 Pseudo-elements change content; pseudo-classes change styles based on an element's state

  * ☝️ What are some ways you could combine pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements?

  * 🙋 Display new content when an element is focused or hovered over

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu_Pseudo-Elements`.

### 13. Student Do: Pseudo-Elements (15 mins)

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Pseudo-Elements

  In this activity, you will work with a partner to use CSS documentation to incorporate pseudo-elements in order to create tooltips.

  ## Instructions

  * Be sure to work with your partner!

  * Navigate to the [CSS Docs on ::after](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::after) in your browser.

  * Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser. We are given a blog post about CSS.

    * As a visitor to this blog, I want to hover over keywords and read short info on it instead of having all of the text on the page.

  * Open both [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) and [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE to examine the code.

  * Using the CSS documentation, implement the following features:

    * In `index.html`, determine which pieces of text can be used as a tooltip for a keyword. 

      * For example, for the first tooltip we can use "Cascading Style Sheets" and assign the tooltip text to say "Commonly known as CSS". Choose one more keyword and phrase to use for tooltips from the other paragraphs.

      * How can you designate the keyword to use a `data-descr` custom data attribute for the tooltip text?

    * In `style.css`, style the keyword and tooltip. 
    
      * When I read the blog, I want to be able to easily identify which word is the keyword with the tooltip by underlining the keyword and changing the cursor into a hand when I hover over it.
      
      * When the tooltip appears above the keyword, it should have the same background color and text color as the header and navbar items. Give the tooltip a rectangular shape and slightly smaller font size than the rest of the page.

  * When in doubt, consult the CSS documentation. And like all things CSS, play around with the properties to position the tooltip where you want it.

  ## 💡 Hint(s)

  * How can we use the `::after` pseudo-element along with the `:hover` and `:focus` selectors to create the tooltip?

  * Don't get too hung up on what pieces of text to use for the keyword and tooltip!

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    * What are some real-life scenarios for using pseudo-elements?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: Pseudo-Elements (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with pseudo-elements? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `data-*` attributes

  * ✔️ `::after` pseudo-elements

  * ✔️ Relative vs absolute positioning

* Open `18-Stu_Pseudo-Elements/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We added a custom `data-descr` attribute to each `<span>` element to hold the hidden tooltip text.

    ```html
    <span data-descr="Commonly known as CSS">Cascading Style Sheets</span>
    ```

* Open `18-Stu_Pseudo-Elements/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We selected every `<span>` element that has a `data-descr` attribute and set the `position` to `relative`. This will help us position the tooltip relative to the `<span>`.

    ```css
    span[data-descr] {
      position: relative;
      text-decoration: underline;
      color: #000;
      cursor: grab;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We combined the `::after` pseudo-element with `:hover` and `:focus` states to insert the tooltip. The content comes from the value of the `data-descr` attribute. The tooltip is positioned absolutely, but relative to its parent.

    ```css
    span[data-descr]:hover::after,
    span[data-descr]:focus::after {
      content: attr(data-descr);
      position: absolute;
      left: 0px;
      bottom: 24px;
      min-width: 200px;
      border: 1px #aaaaaa solid;
      background-color: #13293d;
      padding: 12px;
      color: #fff;
      font-size: 80%;
      z-index: 1;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why did the `<span>` element need relative positioning?

  * 🙋 Absolute positioning requires a positioned parent element

  * ☝️ What purpose does the `data-descr` attribute serve?

  * 🙋 It holds hidden content that the pseudo-element will use later on

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Form Styles (5 mins) 

* Open `19-Ins_Form-Styles/index.html` in your browser. Use the Chrome DevTools to demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 HTML form elements have many default styles applied by the browser.

  * The `<input>` elements have a CSS declaration of `cursor: text`.

  * The `<select>` element has a CSS declaration of `appearance: menulist`.

  * The `<button>` element has an `outline` property applied when you use the DevTools to toggle the `:focus` state.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How can you overwrite these browser defaults?

  * 🙋 Target the same element and property names with CSS

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_Custom-Forms`.

### 16. Student Do: Custom Forms (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_Custom-Forms`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Custom Forms with CSS

  In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer code to learn how to override a browser's default styles for form elements.

  ## Instructions

  * Be sure to work with your partner!

  * Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and scroll down to the comment form on the page. Observe the following behavior:

    * The text inputs have different appearances when empty and when the user has clicked on them.

    * The `<select>` dropdown has a custom graphic replacing the normal arrow.

    * The text next to the checkbox changes when the checkbox is clicked.

  * Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code.

  * Insert comments where specified to explain what each CSS rule is doing.

  ## 💡 Hint(s)

  * This page uses several new pseudo-classes and CSS properties. Refer to the following documentation if you're not sure what they do:

    * [MDN web docs on pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes)

    * [MDN web docs on appearance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/appearance)

    * [MDN web docs on combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Combinators)

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    * What are ARIA attributes and when would you need to use them?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 17. Instructor Review: Custom Forms (15 mins)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with customizing form elements with CSS? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ Sibling selectors

  * ✔️ Vendor prefixes

  * ✔️ Additional pseudo-classes

* Open `20-Stu_Custom-Forms/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We set the `<select>` element's `appearance` to `none` and inserted a background image to replace the arrow that originally came with `appearance`. We used `-moz` and `-webkit` vendor prefixes to ensure this works for other browsers besides Chrome.

    ```css
    select {
      -moz-appearance: none;
      -webkit-appearance: none;
      appearance: none;
      background-image: url("../images/arrow.png");
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-position: right;
      background-size: contain;
    }
    ```

  * We styled the focus and empty states of the `<input>` elements. An empty state can be captured with the `:placeholder-shown` pseudo-class.

    ```css
    .text-input:focus {
      border-right-width: 5px;
    }

    .text-input:placeholder-shown {
      border-style: dashed;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We used a sibling selector to alter the styles of an element that is next to another element. In this case, the `<label>` element is a sibling of the checkbox. The styles change when the checkbox is in a checked state.

    ```css
    .checkbox:checked + label {
      color: #999999;
      font-style: italic;
    }

    .checkbox:checked + label::after {
      margin-left: 10px;
      font-size: 90%;
      content: "(thanks!)";
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does `appearance: none` do?

  * 🙋 Removes any special styling added by the browser

  * ☝️ What did the `+` sign mean in the CSS selector?

  * 🙋 Select the adjacent, sibling element

  * ☝️ How do you know what is and isn't possible with CSS?

  * 🙋 Read the documentation, look up examples, or experiment with the DevTools

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on appearance](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/appearance) and [combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Combinators), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.
