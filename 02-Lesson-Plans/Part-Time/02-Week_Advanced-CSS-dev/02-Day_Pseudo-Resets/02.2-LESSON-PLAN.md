# 02.2 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Advanced CSS

## Overview 

The overall theme of today's class is overwriting browser defaults. Students will implement a CSS reset to zero out certain styles and then rebuild those styles using advanced CSS concepts like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `11-Ins_CSS-Resets` through `20-Stu_Custom-Forms`

* Skim over the [MDN web docs on pseudo-classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), [pseudo-elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements), and [adjacent sibling combinators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator) to get familiar with some of the advanced CSS selectors that students will be using.

* Today's lesson also touches on typography. Students will likely see different fonts on their Windows and macOS machines, so be prepared to discuss web-safe fonts and font fallbacks.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain why you would use a CSS reset

* Use typographical CSS properties like `font-family` and `line-height`

* Add pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements to HTML elements

* Explain the default styles that browsers apply to form elements

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* @TODO The first building block of every class is used to stoke curiosity on the topic. This may be using a slide deck or demonstration of the last activity of the day combined with pseudocoding. How are you going to stoke curiosity? Write two or three sentences describing your approach. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: CSS Resets (5 mins) 

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/index.html` in your browser and explain the following:

  * üîë This page has no style sheet, but the browser already renders elements a certain way.

  * üîë Every browser renders these defaults differently, which can cause unwanted discrepancies.

  * Developers find it helpful to reset these defaults before applying their own styles, allowing them to write CSS with peace of mind.

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/index.html` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * Let's add a style sheet that resets these defaults by uncommenting the following element:

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/reset.css" />
    ```

  * In the browser, all of the margins, padding, and font sizes have been normalized. Now a developer can rebuild these styles from scratch exactly the way they want.

* Open `11-Ins_CSS-Resets/assets/css/reset.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We use a wildcard selector to reset the box size of every element.

    ```css
    * {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }
    ```

  * We give the `html` element a `height` of `100%` and the `body` a `min-height` of `100%` to ensure the document always takes up at least the size of the viewport. This makes it easier to position things like footers.

    ```css
    html {
      height: 100%;
    }

    body {
      min-height: 100%;
      line-height: 1;
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
    ```

  * Several HTML elements like `input` and `button` have their own font styling, so we reset them to match the rest of the page.

    ```css
    input, select, option, optgroup, textarea, button,
    pre, code {
      font-size: 100%;
      font-family: inherit;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why would you want to reset the browser's default CSS?

  * üôã To give yourself a clean starting point, to minimize cross-browser differences

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_CSS-Resets`.

### 3. Student Do: CSS Resets (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `12-Stu_CSS-Resets`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Fix the CSS Reset

  In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug a broken webpage to better explain how a CSS reset works.

  ## Instructions

  * Be sure to work with your partner!

  * Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the page's styles. Note that they currently do not meet the following requirements:

    * As a user, I expect headings to be a larger font size

    * As a user, I expect spacing in between the lines of text

  * To meet these requirements, the page should look like the following image:

    ![The blog layout has larger sized headers and spacing in between the lines of text](./Images/01-correct-styles.png)

  * Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
    
    * What do the DevTools reveal about the CSS rules being applied?
    
    * What do the style sheets in the [assets/css folder](./Unsolved/assets/css/) have in common?
    
    * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

  ## üí° Hint(s)

  * You won't need to write any new CSS rules to fix the styling on this page.

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    * What is Normalize.css and how does it affect different browsers?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: CSS Resets (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with using CSS resets? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Order of precedence

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Selector specificity

* Open `12-Stu_CSS-Resets/Solved/index.html` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We needed to swap the `<link>` elements, so the `reset.css` style sheet loads first.

    ```html
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/reset.css" />
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/css/style.css" />
    ```

  * üîë When style sheets have conflicting CSS rules, like a generic `h1` selector, the style sheet that's loaded second will take precedence.

* Open `12-Stu_CSS-Resets/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * The CSS rules for `<ul>` elements didn't conflict, because the selectors in `style.css` were more specific. For example, a `<ul>` inside of a `<nav>` element.

    ```css
    nav ul {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: space-between;
      min-width: 300px;
    }

    article ul {
      margin-left: 5%;
      font-size: 110%;
      list-style: circle;
    }
    ```

  * üîë A more specific selector will always take precedence over a generic selector.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What other CSS rules conflicted in the two style sheets?

  * üôã They both have a rule for `body`

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why would you always want to load your CSS reset first?

  * üôã To avoid undoing your custom styles

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.


### 5. Instructor Demo: Typography (5 mins) 

* Open `13-Ins_Typography/index.html` in your browser. Inspect the `<p class="one">` element with the Chrome DevTools to explain the following:

  * The class has a `font-family` value of `'Helvetica', 'Arial', sans-serif`.
  
  * üîë Multiple fonts are listed in case the user's operating system can't find the first or second one. Helvetica, for instance, is usually not installed on Windows machines.

  * üîë The `font-weight` and `font-style` properties can make a font appear bold or slanted, but by how much depends on the font being used. `oblique`, for instance, will often look the same as `italic`.

* Inspect the `<p class="four">` element with the Chrome DevTools to demonstrate the following:

  * Setting the `text-transform` property to `uppercase` or `capitalize` will change how the text is capitalized.

  * Setting the `text-decoration` property to `underline` or `line-through` will apply a line to the text.

  * üîë There are many ways to alter a font with CSS, but making a font look good usually comes down to adjusting the `margin`, `line-height`, and `font-size`.

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why should you provide more than one `font-family` value?

  * üôã Not every computer will have the first font specified

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do you know which font properties are available to use?

  * üôã Read the [MDN web docs on fonts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) or experiment with the Chrome DevTools

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Typography`.

### 6. Student Do: Typography (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `14-Stu_Typography`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # Typography

  In this activity, you will work with a partner to use CSS documentation to apply typographic properties to text to make the blog more readable after a CSS reset.

  ## Instructions

  * Be sure to work with your partner!

  * Navigate to the [Fundamental text and font styling article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals) in your browser.

  * Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the text on the page.

    * We are given a blog with all of the default styles reset. The layout has been rebuilt, but the text still needs more work!

  * Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE and examine the code.

  * Using the CSS documentation, implement the following:

    * As a user, I want to view my body font as the default standard size of 16px.

    * When I read paragraphs, it should have a line height of 1.5 times the font height.

    * When I view the headings, it should be 150-200% of the font size and have a font family of serif.

    * When I view the page, there should be a margin of 2-5% on the heading, paragraph, and list.

    * When I see lists, it should be indented, have square bullet points and a font family of monospace.

  * The result should look like the following image:

    ![The blog page includes a monospaced list and headings with a serif font](./Images/01-CSS-typography.png)

  * Add a few personal touches to the text! Play around with the `font-style` and `font-weight` to make the text slant and bold.

  ## üí° Hint(s)

  * Working with CSS should be a creative experience for you! Your end product should look as close to the solution as possible, but feel free to try out other looks!

  ## üèÜ Bonus

  * If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

    * What are some other options for web fonts besides the given basic fonts?

  * Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: Typography (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with CSS fonts? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (üîë) points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Default fonts

  * ‚úîÔ∏è Font percentages

* Open `14-Stu_Typography/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We adjusted the `body` CSS rule to include a base `line-height` and `font-size`.

    ```css
    body {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      line-height: 1.5;
      font-size: 16px;
    }
    ```

  * üîë We added margins to the headers, set the `font-size` to be a percentage of the base font, and set the `font-family` to the operating system's default `serif` font.

    ```css
    h1 {
      margin: 2%;
      font-size: 200%;
      font-family: serif;
    }

    h2 {
      margin: 3% 0;
      font-size: 180%;
      font-family: serif;
    }

    h3 {
      font-size: 150%;
      font-family: serif;
    }
    ```

  * We adjusted the list element's left margin, set the `list-style` to be `square`, and changed the `font-family` to a default `monospace` font.

    ```css
    article ul {
      margin-left: 5%;
      list-style: square;
      font-family: monospace;
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What CSS properties can you use to alter a font?

  * üôã `font-family`, `font-size`, `font-weight`, `font-style`, `text-decoration`, etc.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why is using a percentage for font sizes helpful?

  * üôã We only need to change the base font size to scale other elements accordingly.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN web docs on text fundamentals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Pseudo-Classes (5 mins) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `@TODO/folder/file { AND ARGS, IF ANY }` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * üîë @TODO { WHEN WE DO THIS, IT DOES THAT. }

  * üîë @TODO { WE ALSO SEE THESE THINGS. }

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How would we build this?
