# 02.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Advanced CSS

## Overview 

In today's class, students will implement media queries and flexbox to create a responsive web design. Students will also experiment with styling CSS boxes.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen` through `10-Stu_Box-Styling`.

* Be sure to prepare and read over the activities before your class begins. Try to anticipate any questions students may have.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* When reviewing activities, ask for volunteers to share their solutions and/or ask students to walk through the solution line-by-line.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

* @TODO Add Slide Deck

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Implement basic media queries for screen

* Implement a CSS grid to accomplish a complex layout

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive web design

* Utilize flexbox justification and alignment properties for spacing

* Enhance the UI of webpage using box styling

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 mins)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open `28-Stu_Mini-Project/Solved/index.html` in your browser and open Chrome DevTools to demonstrate simulating a mobile viewport.

  * In order to access the Chrome DevTools, we can press Cmd+Opt+I on Mac or Ctrl+Shift+I on Windows.

  * We can enable the device emulator by clicking the "Toggle device toolbar" icon in the top-left.

  * We can select Responsive and drag the edges of the screen to any size we want. Or we can choose from the drop-down list of popular devices.

  * Right now, we are viewing the mini-project that we will build on Day 3. You will be able to build this by the end of this unit!

  * Notice what happens to the layout when we change the screen size. The columns shift and stack as the screen gets smaller. This is called Responsive Web Design and this is accomplished by using media queries and flexbox. 

### 2. Instructor Demo: Media Query for Screen (5 mins) 

@TODO USE THE FOLLOWING FOR BROWSER AND/OR COMMAND LINE DEMOS, RESPECTIVELY. REMOVE IF UNUSED

* Open `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We see a dark blue header, a dark tan navbar, a green sidebar, and a white body section. We also see white image placeholders. 

  * 🔑 When we open Chrome DevTools and start shrinking the screen size, these components change colors! 

  * 🔑 First, the header will change to a deep red color when the screen size hits 992px. Then, the navbar will change to a dark pink color when the screen size hits 768px. Finally, the image placeholders will change to a blue color when the screen size hits 576px or smaller.

  * This is all possible by using media queries.

* Open `01-Ins_Media-Query-Screen/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * When we are using `max-width` as the breakpoint, we need to go from widest to narrowest to avoid any conflicts.

  * We use `@media screen` and then set the breakpoint using `max-width`:

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px) 
    ```

  * Then we set the styles that will change at that breakpoint. For us, it was changing the header color.

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
      header {
        background: #772014;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 768px, we changed the navbar color.

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      nav {
        background-color: #bb8588;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 576px, we changed the image placeholders' colors.

    ```cs
    @media screen and (max-width: 576px) {
      .sample-img {
        background-color: #8ac4ff;
      }
    }
    ```

  * Of course, we can change more than just the background colors when the screen size gets smaller. Do you remember what the layout of the page looked like when we shrank that screen size earlier?

* Go back to the `index.html` in the browser and demonstrate how squished the layout looks.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will need to use media queries to change the width of the components so that they will stack on top of each other when the screen size gets smaller.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Media Query for Screen (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Media Queries for Screen

In this activity, you will work with a partner to implement basic media queries for screen.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and make the screen size smaller. Notice what happens to the products on the page.

* As an online shopper, I want to view products clearly on my mobile phone as well as my computer.

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * When the screen size is larger than 992 px, the product cards on the screen are side-by-side.

  * But when I change the screen size to 992 px or smaller, the product cards on the screen should split into two columns.

  ![The product cards are split into two columns evenly](./Images/01-product-columns.png)

  * When I change the screen size to 768 px or smaller, the product cards on the screen should be stacked on top of each other.

  ![The product cards are stacked on top of each other](./Images/02-products-stacked.png)

* Optional: Just for fun, change the background color of the header each time the product cards change layout. 

## 💡 Hint(s)

* What is the media feature we use to check for the maximum width of the display area?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is mobile-first design?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 4. Instructor Review: Media Query for Screen (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with media queries for screen? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `@media screen`

  * ✔️ `width` of cards

* Open `02-Stu_Media-Query-Screen/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We are given an online store webpage with product cards. When the screen size gets smaller, the product cards shift so they are clearly viewable on a smaller screen.

  * If we look at the code for when the screen size is larger than 992px wide, we see the cards have a width of 25% since there are 4 cards. The cards lay side-by-side in a row.

    ```css
    .card {
      width: 25%;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 But as the screen gets smaller, we need to have them stacked. So first, we use a media query with a breakpoint of 992px. 

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px)
    ```

  * 🔑 Then we give the cards a `width` of 50% which will cause half of the cards to stack beneath the other half.

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 992px) {
      .card {
        width: 50%;
      }
    }
    ```

  * For the breakpoint of 768px, we go back to allowing the card width to be 100%.

    ```css
    @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
      .card {
        width: 100%;
      }
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is a more efficient way to control the layout of a webpage?

  * 🙋 We can use flexbox, which is the next activity!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [CSS Docs on Media Queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Layout (5 mins) 

* Open `03-Ins_Flexbox-Layout/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * 🔑 We see a simple header on top with 4 cards in the body section. The cards consist of just a header. But we see that the "Camera" card is larger than the rest.

* Open `03-Ins_Flexbox-Layout/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 To create a flex container, we set the value of the `display` property to `flex`.

  ```css
  main {
    display: flex;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 To align the items and distribute the empty space between the child elements of the flex container, we use `justify-content`. There are different values we can assign, like `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-around`, `space-evenly`, and `sapce-between` which is what we used in our example.

  ```css
  .main-header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 When we want to control how the items will grow or shrink according to the available space, we can use the `flex` properties: `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`. Usually we just use the `flex` shorthand to set the three values of those properties in that order.

  ```css
  .card {
    /* A flex-basis of 200px sets the starting width */
    /* A flex-grow value of 1 allows the elements to evenly grow to fill the remaining space */
    flex: 1 0 200px;
  }

  .card.camera {
    /* With a flex-grow value of 2, this element grows twice as wide as others */
    /* The second value, flex-shrink, defines how the element will shrink if it can't fit */
    flex: 2 1 200px;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will need to use the flexbox in order to implement a grid layout to ensure that all of the items are clearly shown on the page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: Flexbox Layout (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Fix the Flexbox Layout

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug some broken code to implement a grid layout with flexbox properties.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the page's layout. Note that it currently does not meet the following requirements:

  * As a user, I want to view all products in two or more rows

  * As a user, I don't want to scroll horizontally to see additional products

* To meet these requirements, the page should look similar to the following image:

  ![The products that don't fit on the first line of the grid are moved to the second line](./Images/01-product-grid.png)

* Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
  
  * What do the DevTools reveal about the elements?
  
  * What CSS rules in [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) are affecting these elements?
  
  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Research what the default behavior of flexbox is and experiment with some of flexbox's other properties to see how to change those defaults.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. In what other directions could it run?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 8. Instructor Review: Flexbox Layout (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with `flexbox layouts`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `display: flex`

  * ✔️ `flex-wrap: wrap`

* Open `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

  * Let's open Chrome DevTools and toggle the device toolbar. When we make the screen smaller, notice what happens to the header and the product cards. The text in the header is squished and the product cards run off the page! 
  
  * So we know, the broken code that we need to debug and fix is the `.main-header` and the product cards in the `main` container.

* Open `04-Stu_Flexbox-Layout/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 The `main` container and the `.main-header` already have the `display` property set to `flex`

    ```css
    main {
      display: flex;
    }

    .main-header {
      display: flex;
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 We just need to set the `flex-wrap` property to `wrap` so that the elements are forced to wrap over to the next line if they don't fit.

  ```css
  main {
    display: flex;
    /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }

  .main-header {
    display: flex;
    /* Forces elements to the next line if they don't fit */
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. In what other directions could it run?

  * 🙋 Flexbox can also run from top to bottom in columns!

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [CSS Docs on Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Responsive Design (5 mins) 

* Open `05-Ins_Responsive-Design/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * Let's open Chrome DevTools and shrink the screen size to see what happens to the different elements on the page.

  * 🔑 When we hit 780px or smaller, we see the navbar links stack on top of each other.

  * 🔑 We also forced the sidebar to stack below the body instead of on top of it.

* Open `05-Ins_Responsive-Design/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * We accomplished that by using media queries and flexbox properties! 
  
  * 🔑 We gave the `flex-direction` property of both `main` and `nav` a value of `column` so that it stacks on top of each other.

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    main,
    nav {
      flex-direction: column;
    }
  ```

  * 🔑 We forced the sidebar `aside` to stack below the body by assigning the `order` property to a value of `2`.

  ```css
  aside {
    order: 2;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will need to figure out what flexbox properties are being used at each breakpoint to make the layout change at different screen sizes.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/README.md`.

### 9. Student Do: Responsive Design (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/README.md`.

* This activity won't require any coding but instead students will need to reverse engineer code and figure out what is allowing the layout to change at certain breakpoints. Guiding questions have been provided; students will need to write their answers as comments.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# Responsive Design

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code.

  * There are questions written as comments throughout the code. 

  * Write your answers as comments under the questions in the space provided.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Refer to the previous activities on media queries and flexbox.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 10. BREAK (15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Review: Responsive Design (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with `responsive web design using media queries and flexbox`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `display: flex`

  * ✔️ `flex-wrap`

  * ✔️ `flex-shrink`

  * ✔️ `justify-content`

  * ✔️ `flex` shorthand

  * ✔️ `flex-direction`

* Open `06-Stu_Responsive-Design/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * This activity didn't require any coding on our part. Instead we were given a fully functioning webpage and we had to explain how it works! Through this kind of activity, we can improve our computational thinking skills. 

* Go through each question (🔑) in the `style.css` and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * 🔑 What happens when we set the `display` property to `flex`?

  * 🙋 The `flex` container becomes flexible! The child items of the container all move into a row and take only as much space as they need to display their contents.

  ```css
  nav {
    display: flex;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 What is the `flex-wrap` property?

  * 🙋 It specifies whether the flex items should wrap or not. The value can be set to `nowrap`, `wrap`, or `wrap-reverse`.

  ```css
  main {
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 What does the `flex-shrink` property specify?

  * 🙋 It specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items. In our activity, we are telling the `footer` not to shrink as much as the other items by setting `flex-shrink` to `0`.

  ```css
  footer {
    flex-shrink: 0;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 What does the `justify-content` property do?

  * 🙋 It is used to align the flex items and distribute the empty space between them. In our activity, we are telling the product cards to be centered.

  ```css
  .products {
    flex: 4;
    display: flex;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    justify-content: center;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 What is the `flex` property a shorthand property for?

  * 🙋 It is a shorthand property for the `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` properties in that order. In our activity, we are making the product cards not growable, not shrinkable, and with an initial length of 400px.

  ```css
  .card {
    flex: 0 0 400px;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 What does the `flex-direction` property define?

  * 🙋 It defines in which direction the container wants to stack its flex items. In our activity, we are telling the main body element and the navbar to stack vertically in a column.

  ```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    main,
    nav {
      flex-direction: column;
    }
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

  * 🙋 We can use the CSS grid layout.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [CSS Docs on the Flexible Box Layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Flexbox Placement (5 mins) 

* Open `07-Ins_Flexbox-Placement/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 When we change the screen size, the two product cards remain centered at all times.

* Open `07-Ins_Flexbox-Placement/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following:

  * 🔑 We have already set the `display` to `flex` and the `flex-direction` to `row`.

  ```css
  .products {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Since we set the `flex-direction` to `row`, that becomes our main axis. We use `justify-content: center` to center the items along the main axis.

  ```css
  .products {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
    justify-content: center;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Then we can use `align-items` to center them along the opposite axis (vertically).

  ```css
  .products {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
    justify-content: center;
    /* Centers along the opposite axis */
    align-items: center;
  }
  ```
  
  * 🔑 Finally, we set the height according to the height of the viewport.

  ```css
  .products {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    /* Centers along the main axis determined by flex-direction */
    justify-content: center;
    /* Centers along the opposite axis */
    align-items: center;
    /* Uses the height of the viewport */
    height: 100vh;
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We will need to use `justify-content` and `align-items` accordingly to align the child elements correctly.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/README.md`.

### 13. Student Do: Flexbox Placement (15 mins) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the different components on the page. Note that they currently do not meet the following requirements:

  * As a user, I want the navigation buttons to be on the right side

  * As a user, I want the slideshow buttons to be normal sized and centered alongside the image

* To meet these requirements, the page should look like the following image:

  ![The navigation links are aligned to the right, and the slideshow buttons are center aligned](./Images/01-product-page.png)

* Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
  
  * What do the DevTools reveal about the navigation and slideshow components?
  
  * What CSS rules in [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) are affecting these components?
  
  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Look up the other possible values for flexbox's alignment and justification properties.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What e-commerce websites can you find that are using flexbox properties to help organize their components and layouts?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help while circulating through room.

### 14. Instructor Review: Flexbox Placement (10 mins) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with `flexbox justification and alignment`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points below to review the following key (🔑) points:

  * ✔️ `justify-content: flex-end`

  * ✔️ `align-items: flex-start`

  * ✔️ `align-items: center`

* Open `08-Stu-Flexbox-Placement/Unsolved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following: 

  * We see the navbar links are on the left, but we need them on the right side.

  * We also see the long slideshow buttons on both sides of the image. We need to make them smaller and centered.

* Open `08-Stu_Flexbox-Placement/Solved/assets/css/style.css` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 First we need to align the navbar links to the far right, or the `end` of the navbar. We do that by giving the `justify-content` property a value of `flex-end`.

  ```css
  nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: flex-end;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 Next we need to fix the slideshow buttons. 

  ```css
  .product {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
    width: 90%;
    margin: 1% auto;
  }
  ```
  * 🔑 We set `align-items` to `flex-start` this time so that the child elements will align to the top of the parent.

  ```css
  .product {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
    width: 90%;
    margin: 1% auto;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 @TODO DON'T FORGET TO USE THE KEY EMOJI ON KEY POINTS, BUT ONLY KEY POINTS, NOT _EVERY_ POINT

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * 🙋 @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for Office Hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.
