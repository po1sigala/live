# Unit 02 Instructor Overview: Advanced CSS

## Overview

In this unit, students will implement media queries and flexbox to create a responsive web design. Students will also overwrite browser defaults using a CSS reset and then rebuild those styles using advanced CSS concepts like pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo each day to have that day's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* Be ready to use Chrome DevTools and the device emulator to quickly show different CSS concepts on different screen sizes.

* Make sure to remind students that although CSS is a broad language with many tricks to learn, they will continue to build their CSS knowledge throughout the entire course.

* When learning about typography, students will likely see different fonts on their Windows and macOS machines, so be prepared to discuss web-safe fonts and font fallbacks.

## Career Connection

Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [important folder](../../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/04-Important/CAREER-CONNECTION.md).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

* Next week, you will introduce students to JavaScript! This may be a big leap for some students. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and be available during Office Hours. 

* Starting with the next unit, students will start solving common algorithms that they will see in technical interviews. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these problems so that you can help students with any questions they might have.
