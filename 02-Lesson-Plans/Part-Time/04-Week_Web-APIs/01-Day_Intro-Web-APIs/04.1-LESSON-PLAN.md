04.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to Web APIs

## Overview

This class introduces the Document Object Model. Students will gain experience using Web APIs to create, get, and append elements. Students will also learn to set attributes and work with timers while reinforcing their existing JavaScript skills.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Window-Object` through `10-Timers-Intervals`.

* This unit introduces DOM traversal and manipulation. This is a challenging topic for learners new to programming. If students feel overwhelmed, encourage them to talk over the challenge -- in plain language -- with their partner before they begin to write their solutions. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

* By the end of class students will be able to:

  * Inspect the `window` object via `this`.

  * Traverse the DOM using various Web APIs.

  * Query the DOM for elements by their selector.

  * Use `setAttribute()` to add styles to specific elements.

  * Implement timers and intervals using `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [Unit 4 Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D3DGPpajoRdzTxMterML_jQqcIy_yhoCrUSdpJhYE5Q/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Web APIs**: In this unit, we will learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML with the help of Web APIs. 

  * **What is the web browser?**: 
    * A web browser, or browser, is a program used to access information on the World Wide Web.

    * Every webpage, image, and video on the web can be accessed via a specific Unified Resource Link (URL).
    * Browsers use the URL to retrieve resources from a web server and display them on a user's device.
  
  * **What is an API?**
    * An API is a set of methods, properties, events, and URLs that developers use to interact with components of a user's web browser.

    * APIs can also interact with data sets, hardware/software on a user‚Äôs computer, or third-party software and services.
    
    **What is a Web API?**
    * Web APIs are built into the web browser and contain methods that allow us to manipulate a webpage using JavaScript.

    * We use Web APIs to create elements and add them to the browser or to add and remove styles and attributes‚Äîall via JavaScript.
    
    **What is the DOM?**
    * When we open a webpage, the browser creates a tree of objects that represent the opened page. 

    * That tree of objects is the DOM.

    * Using the DOM, we manipulate the HTML elements on the page using JavaScript. 
    
  * In this unit, we are going to take the next step in building interactive web pages by learning how to harness the power of the DOM and Web APIs to access, create, and change HTML using JavaScript.
  
  * Let's take a quick look at the mini-project we will do at the end of this unit.

* Navigate to `27-Stu_Timer-App/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The Tomato Timer has a number of features that harness the power of JavaScript to make the app interactive.

  * We can toggle between resting and working mode.

  * We can turn the timer on, pause it, and reset it using the push of a button.

  * We can change the minutes of work and the minutes of rest.

  * While the app may look daunting at first, this app builds on the web fundamentals we already know: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In addition, much of the complex functionality is actually handled by Web APIs, allowing us to create all the functionality we just saw in a few lines of code. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use Web APIs to create and manipulate HTML elements. This will allow us to add complex functionality to our projects with just a few lines of code. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We will create our project's framework with HTML, style with CSS and functionality with JavaScript just as we have been learning to do. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Web APIs are key to developing fully functional, interactive apps for the web. In addition, understanding the DOM is a key tool in any developer's toolbox.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: 01-Ins_Window-Object (5 min) 

* Open `01-Ins_Window-Object/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë The window object represents an open window in a browser. When we log `this`, the window object is returned.

  * üîë When we open up the window object, we can see the properties and methods that belong to the window. We already used the window methods `alert()`, `confirm()` and `prompt()` in our Rock, Paper, Scissors mini-project. 

  * üîë The document is a property of the window object that represents open web page. We see this association when we log `document.defaultView` and the window object associated wth the document is returned.

  * üîë We log `document.body` to access what is contained in the `<body>` of the document. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What does the window object represent?

  * üôã An open window in the browser. The window object has a property called document, which represents the open web page.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Window-Object\README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Window Object (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Window-Object\README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Window Object (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the window object? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è window

  * ‚úîÔ∏è window.document

  * ‚úîÔ∏è document.documentElement

  * ‚úîÔ∏è document.head

* Open `02-Stu_Window-Object/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * The `window` represents an browser window. We log `window` to return the window object.

  ```js
  console.log(window);
  ```

  * üîë The document is a property of the window object. We log `window.document` to return a reference to the entire document.

  ```js
  console.log(window.document);
  ```

  * üîë The document serves as the entry point to access a web page's content. We use `document.documentElement` to log the root element or the `<HTML>`.

  ```js
  console.log(document.documentElement);
  ```

  * We use `document.head` to log the `<head>` element. 

  ```js
  console.log(document.head);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use the window's document property to access HTML elements? 

  * üôã The document is an entry point for a web page's content. To access an HTML element, we start by accessing the document and then the property such as head or body.  

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) and [MDN Web Docs on Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: DOM Traversal (5 min) 

* Open `03-Ins_Traverse-DOM/script.js` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë The document is the entry point for the DOM. We log `document.body` to access the <body> contained in the document.

  * üîë We can view the elements nested inside the <body> by logging `document.body.children`.

  * üîë To access the first element in the body, we log `document.body.children[0]`.

  * üîë To access an element nested in another element, we log `document.body.children[1].children[0]`.

  * üîë We can also access the same element using its id.

  * üîë Each HTML element contains a style object that contains all the style properties available to the object. 

* Open `03-Ins_Traverse-DOM/index.html` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë DOM Traveral allows us to access the DOM using parent-child relationships. 

  ```js
  console.log(document.body.children[1].children[0]);
  ```
  
  * üîë We can also access an element inside a body directly by targeting the id of the element using `.getElementbyId()`.

  ```js
  var childNode1 = document.getElementById("childNode1")
  console.log(childNode1);
  ```

  * üîë We can set and change an element's style settings using JavaScript by accessing the style object and its properties. 

  ```js
  childNode1.style.color = "green";
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use parent-child relationships to access an element inside the body?

  * üôã Elements nested inside a parent element are called children. We access the children through the parent element using dot notation.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use an element's id to access an element?

  * üôã We use the document method `.getElementbyId()` to quickly access an element directly using its id. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Traverse-DOM/Unsolved/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: DOM Traversal (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Traverse-DOM/Unsolved/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 7. Instructor Review: DOM Traversal (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with Dom Traversal? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .getElementById()

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .children[0]

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .style.property

* Open `04-Stu_Traverse-DOM/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We access the `articles` and `main` div using the document method `.getElementById()`

  ```js
  var articlesDiv = document.getElementById("articles");
  var mainDiv = document.getElementById("main");
  ```

  * üîë To access elements nested inside the `div`, we use `.children`, The title is the first nested element in the `articles` div, so we use `.children[0]`.

  ```js
  articlesDiv.children[0].style.fontSize = "50px";
  ```

  * üîë We can change and set styles by accessing an element's style object and properties.

  ```js
  mainDiv.children[1].style.color = "white";
  ```
  
* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we set a style of an element using the DOM? 

  * üôã We can access the element's style object and change or set a style property using the `=` assignment operator.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on ElementCSSInlineStyle.style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementCSSInlineStyle/style), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Do: Setting Attributes (10 mins)

* Navigate to [04-Ins_Setting-Attributes index.html](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/04-Ins_Setting-Attributes/index.html) and open it in your browser.

* Ask the class, "How do we feel about this style?"

* We can traverse the DOM and set styles via the `.style` method, now we are going to learn about `.setAttribute`.

* `setAttribute` is a DOM method that allows us to add any attribute to an element. We can use it to add styles, hrefs, img srcs, and any other attribute you would like to add.

* If the attribute already exists, the value will be updated. If there is no attribute, a new attribute is added with the specified name and value.

* Navigate to [04-Ins_Setting-Attributes script.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/04-Ins_Setting-Attributes/script.js) in your IDE.

  * When we uncomment this code and navigate back to the page styles will have been changed and an image added, all via JavaScript.

* Here we used `querySelector` and `querySelectorAll` to gather our elements into variables rather than using the more specific document methods. 

  * We used `querySelector` because it allows us to select an element by tag, class name, or ID. This makes it more flexible than using `getElementById` or `getElementByClassName`.

  * We used `querySelectorAll` because it allows us to select all elements of the same tag, class name, or ID. This is much more useful than `getElementsByTagName` or other group selectors.

  * These two methods are the most useful and versatile because they can be used to target any element we would ever like to target.

* Ask the class, "How was all of the styling done if there is no CSS?"

  * All the styling done to the page uses the method, `.setAttribute`.

  * The `setAttribute` method takes in two arguments, first is the name of the attribute, and the second is its value. i.e., `setAttribute("style", "color:white;");

  * The major difference between setting styles with `.setAttribute` vs the `.style` methods is that when using `setAttribute` we enter the CSS properties and values like we would in a normal external stylesheet or inline styling.

* Answer any questions students may have and let them know its their turn to work with `setAttribute()`.

### 8. Student Do: Setting Attributes (10 mins)

* Direct students to the next activity, found in [05-Stu_Setting-Attributes](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/05-Stu_Setting-Attributes/Unsolved).

```md
# Setting Attributes

In this activity you are going to use JavaScript to add `hrefs` to `a` tags, `src` to `img` tags, along with some styles all while traversing the DOM.

## Instructions

* Open `index.html` and familiarize yourself with the structure of the HTML.

* Inside of your provided `script` complete the following: 

  * Give a `src` and `alt` attribute to the 3 provided `img` tags.

  * Give a `href` attribute to the 3 provided `a` tags.`

  * Add styles via `setAttribute` to make the page look decent. Recommended: margins and padding.

* **Hint**: You may need a for loop!
```

### 9. Instructor Do: Review Setting Attributes (5 mins)

* Navigate to [05-Stu_Setting-Attributes script.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/05-Stu_Setting-Attributes/Solved/script.js) and open it in your IDE, point out the following to students:

  * We first gather all of our elements we would like to target.

  ```js
  var main = document.getElementById("main");
  var sitesEl = document.querySelectorAll("sites");
  var site1El = document.querySelector(".site1");
  var site2El = document.querySelector(".site2");
  var site3El = document.querySelector(".site3");
  var siteTitles = document.querySelectorAll("h4");
  ```

  * We can then use the array returned by `.children` to navigate and setAttributes to elements.

  ```js
  site1El.children[1].setAttribute("href", "https://google.com");
  ```

  * Whenever we use `setAttribute` it takes two arguments. The first being the name of the attribute and the second its value.

  ```js
  site1El.children[1].children[0].setAttribute("src", "http://placekitten.com/200/200");
  site1El.children[1].children[0].setAttribute("style", "padding:10px;");
  ```

* Answer any questions that remain and then dismiss the class for their break.

### 10. BREAK (15 mins)

### 11. Instructor Do: Create and Append (10 mins)

* Welcome students back from break and get right into our next topic, creating HTML elements and appending them to the DOM via JavaScript.

* Navigate to [06-Ins_Create-Append/index.html](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/06-Ins_Create-Append/index.html) in your browser and demo its functionality.

  * It will ask for a tag to create using prompts, and append the given element to the page.
  
  * If a proper tag name is not given it will let the user know and not create the element.

* Ask the class, "How was this functionality achieved?"

  * This is done using the DOM methods `.createElement` and `.appendChild`.

  * When using `.createElement` we pass in the name of the tag we would like to create and store it as a variable so we can later add it to the DOM.

  ```js
  var newDiv = document.createElement("div");
  ```

  * For us to show our newly created div on the page, we need to append it to the DOM via an existing element.

  ```js
  document.body.appendChild(newDiv);
  ```

  * The above code would `append` newDiv to the body as a child element.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Student Do: Look Ma! No HTML! (30 mins)

* Direct students to the next activity, found in [07-Stu_LookMaNoHTML](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/07-Stu_LookMaNoHTML/Unsolved).

```md
# Look Ma! No HTML

In this activity you are going to use DOM methods to create an entire HTML page.

## Instructions

* You have been provided a standard HTML document. 

* You may only work inside your `script`.

* Inside `script` and using only DOM methods, create an entire HTML page. It should include:

  * A centered h1 with a centered h2 under it.

  * A centered image, with a center caption under it.

  * A list of your favorite foods (or some other list of favorites).

  * Some extra styling to all elements.
```

### 13. Instructor Do: Review Look Ma! No HTML! (5 mins)

* Navigate to [07-Stu_LookMaNoHTML/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/07-Stu_LookMaNoHTML/Solved)and open the solved `script.js` file in your IDE.

* The solution is split into 4 sections, go through each section with the class.

  * The first portion contains all of our references to existing elements, as well as all of our `.createElement` calls.

  * The next portion sets all of the `textContent` of our created elements.

  * Next we begin the process of appending all of our created elements with the newly modified text content.

  * Finally we go through all of our elements and use `.setAttribute` to change the styles and set image sources.

* Answer any questions students have about the solution and move onto our final topic of the day, timers.

### 14. Instructor Do: Timers and Intervals (10 mins)

* Executing code on a timer or interval allows us to set some amount of time to pass between functionality.

* Ask the class, "Where are timers used in applications?"

  * Countdowns

  * Calendars

  * Games

* Navigate to [08-Ins_Timers-Intervals](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/08-Ins_Timers-Intervals) and open the `index.html` in your browser. Demo the application to students and point out the following:

  * After the countdown completes, an image is loaded to the browser all without user interaction.

* Ask the class, "What allowed us to do this?"

  * The `setInterval` function allows us to complete code after a specific amount of time has passed.

* Navigate to [08-Ins_Timers-Intervals script.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/08-Ins_Timers-Intervals/script.js) and open it in your IDE. Explain the following points to students:

  * First we declare our `setInterval` function and assign it to a variable. We will get to why we store it in a variable at the end.

  ```js
  var timerInterval = setInterval(function() {
  ```

  * Next, we decrement our `secondsLeft` variable that we initially set to `10`.

  ```js
  secondsLeft--;
  ```

  * As each second passes we set the textContent of our `timeEl` to display the `secondsLeft` variable concatenated with a string. If our `secondsLeft` is 0, we then `clearInterval` and execute our `sendMessage` function.

  ```js
  timeEl.textContent = secondsLeft + " seconds left till colorsplosion.";
  if(secondsLeft === 0) {
    clearInterval(timerInterval);
    sendMessage();
  }
  ```

* Sometimes programmers want functionality to happen after a set period of time, and not all right away. We use timers to achieve this result.

* `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are two methods that allow for us to execute code based on time.

  * These two methods are actually above the `document` object and are attached directly to the `window`.

* When using either of these timer methods, The first parameter is a function to be executed. The second parameter indicates the amount of time in milliseconds before execution.

  ```js
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log("complete");
  }, 1000);

  setInterval(function(){
    console.log("this will show every second");
  }, 1000)
  ```

* `setTimeout` will execute the body of the function one time, once the allotted amount of time has passed.

  * `setInterval` will execute the body of the function every X amount of milliseconds as specified in the second argument to the `setInterval` function.

* Ask the class why they think we might need to clear an interval that we started.

  * If we do not `clearInterval`, the interval would continue to run indefinitely. We stored our `setInterval` function in a variable so we could pass that instance into our `clearInterval`, stopping execution.

  * `setTimeout` has its own method for stopping execution, `clearTimeout`.

* Answer any questions students may have about the demo. 

### 15. Student Do: Speed Reader (20 mins)

* Direct students to the final activity of class, in [09-Stu_SpeedReader](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/09-Stu_SpeedReader/Unsolved).

```md
# Speed Reader 

In this activity you are going to create a speed reading application. It will input a single word on the screen at a time, changing to the next word after 1 second. This equates to reading at 60 Words Per Minute (WPM).

## Instructions

* The app should countdown from 5, and when the countdown is finished it should print one word to the screen every second. Each word replaces the other.

* Open `index.html` and create the necessary HTML. You will need at least 3 elements.

* Open `script`.

  * The two function names have been created for you, as well as a poem to speed read.

* Fill out the necessary code that would create a countdown timer. When that timer completes, it should dissapear and speed reading should begin.
```

### 16. Instructor Do: Review Speed Reader (10 mins)

* Navigate to [09-Stu_SpeedReader/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/09-Stu_SpeedReader/Solved)

* Open the solved `script` file and show students the completed solution.

* Point out these main points to students:

  * In our `prepareRead` function we store our interval in a variable so we can clear it later.

  ```js
  var timeInterval = setInterval(function() {
  ```

  * When the timer has run out, we empty the `textContent` of the `timerEl` and then execute our `speedRead` function.

  ```js
  if (timeLeft === 0) {
    timerEl.textContent = " ";
    speedRead();
    clearInterval(timeInterval);
  }
  ```

  * We used a prompt to ask the user to enter the speed at which they would like to read, we passed that response in as the second argument of our `speedRead` setInterval.

  ```js
  }, speed);
  ```

   * As opposed to a fixed value, i.e.,

   ```js
   }, 1000);
   ```

  * In the beginning of our `speedRead` function we append our `bodyEl`, generated via `createElement`, to the `mainEl` of our HTML page.

  ```js
  mainEl.append(bodyEl);
  ```

  * We use an `if` statement to check whether the piece we are reading is over. When `words[i]` begins to evaluate to undefined and not a word, we terminate the interval via `clearInterval`. As long as `words[i]` evaluates to a word from our array, we make the content of our `mainEl` reflect that.

  ```js
  if (words[i] === undefined) {
    clearInterval(poemInterval);
  } else {
    mainEl.textContent = words[i];
    i++;
  }
  ```
