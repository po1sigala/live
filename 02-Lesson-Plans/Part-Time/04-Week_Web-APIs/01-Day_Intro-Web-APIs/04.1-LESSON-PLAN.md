04.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Introduction to Web APIs

## Overview

This class introduces the Document Object Model. Students will gain experience using Web APIs to create, get, and append elements. Students will also learn to set attributes and work with timers while reinforcing their existing JavaScript skills.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `01-Ins_Window-Object` through `10-Timers-Intervals`.

* This unit introduces DOM traversal and manipulation. This is a challenging topic for learners new to programming. If students feel overwhelmed, encourage them to talk over the challenge -- in plain language -- with their partner before they begin to write their solutions. It may also be helpful to encourage them to reference the [visual of the DOM tree](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D3DGPpajoRdzTxMterML_jQqcIy_yhoCrUSdpJhYE5Q/edit#slide=id.g61fae5cd04_0_31) found in the Slide Deck. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

* By the end of class students will be able to:

  * Inspect the `window` object

  * Traverse the DOM using various Web APIs

  * Query the DOM for elements by their selector.

  * Use `setAttribute()` to add styles to specific elements

  * Implement timers and intervals using `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()`.

## Class Instruction

### 1. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class.

* Open the [Unit 4 Slide Deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1D3DGPpajoRdzTxMterML_jQqcIy_yhoCrUSdpJhYE5Q/edit?usp=sharing) and follow these prompts on their corresponding slides:

  * **Web APIs**: In this unit, we will learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate HTML with the help of Web APIs. 

  * **What is the web browser?**: 
    * A web browser, or browser, is a program used to access information on the World Wide Web.

    * Every webpage, image, and video on the web can be accessed via a specific Unified Resource Link (URL).

    * Browsers use the URL to retrieve resources from a web server and display them on a user's device.
  
  * **What is an API?**
    * An API is a set of methods, properties, events, and URLs that developers use to interact with components of a user's web browser.

    * APIs can also interact with data sets, hardware/software on a user‚Äôs computer, or third-party software and services.
    
    **What is a Web API?**
    * Web APIs are built into the web browser and contain methods that allow us to manipulate a webpage using JavaScript.

    * We use Web APIs to create elements and add them to the browser or to add and remove styles and attributes‚Äîall via JavaScript.
    
    **What is the DOM?**
    * When we open a webpage, the browser creates a tree of objects that represent the opened page. 

    * That tree of objects is the DOM.

    * Using the DOM, we can manipulate the HTML elements on the page using JavaScript. 
    
  * In this unit, we are going to take the next step in building interactive web pages by learning how to harness the power of the DOM and Web APIs to access, create, and change HTML using JavaScript.
  
  * Let's take a quick look at the mini-project we will do at the end of this unit.

* Navigate to `27-Stu_Timer-App/Solved/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * The Tomato Timer has a number of features that harness the power of Web APIs to make the app interactive.

  * We can toggle between resting and working mode.

  * We can turn the timer on, pause it, and reset it using the push of a button.

  * We can change the minutes of work and the minutes of rest to customize the app.

  * While the app may look a bit daunting right now, this app builds on the web fundamentals we already know: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The complex functionality is handleed with Web APIs and can be implemented with just a few lines of code.  

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What are we learning?

  * üôã We are learning to use Web APIs to create and manipulate HTML elements. This will allow us to easily add complex functionality to our projects and make our apps more interactive.  

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project build off or extend previously learned material?

  * üôã We will create our project's framework with HTML, style with CSS and functionality with JavaScript.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How does this project relate to your career goals?

  * üôã Web APIs are key to developing fully functional, interactive apps for the web. In addition, understanding the DOM is a key tool in any developer's toolbox.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 2. Instructor Demo: 01-Ins_Window-Object (5 min) 

* Open `01-Ins_Window-Object/index.html` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë The window object represents an open window in a browser. When we log `this`, the window object is returned.

  * üîë When we open up the window object, we can see the properties and methods that belong to the window. 

  * üîë The document is a property of the window object. We log `document.window` to return the document interface.

  * üîë The document is the entry point for the web page's content. We log `document.body` to access the `<body>` element. 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the window object?

  * üôã The window object represent an open window in the browser. The window object also has a property called document, which represents an open web page. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How do we access a web page's content?

  * üôã We access a web page's content through the document. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Window-Object\README.md`.

### 3. Student Do: Window Object (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `02-Stu_Window-Object\README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md

```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 4. Instructor Review: Window Object (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with the window object? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è window

  * ‚úîÔ∏è window.document

  * ‚úîÔ∏è document.documentElement

  * ‚úîÔ∏è document.head

* Open `02-Stu_Window-Object/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * The `window` represents an browser window. We log `window` to return the window object.

  ```js
  console.log(window);
  ```

  * üîë The document is a property of the window object. We log `window.document` to return a reference to the entire document.

  ```js
  console.log(window.document);
  ```

  * üîë The document serves as the entry point to access a web page's content. We use `document.documentElement` to log the document's root element or the `<HTML>`.

  ```js
  console.log(document.documentElement);
  ```

  * We use `document.head` to log the document's `<head>` element. 

  ```js
  console.log(document.head);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use the window's document property to access a web page's content? 

  * üôã The document is an entry point for a web page's content. To access an HTML element, we start by accessing the document and then work our way down the DOM tree.  

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) and [MDN Web Docs on Document](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 5. Instructor Demo: DOM Traversal (5 min) 

* Open `03-Ins_Traverse-DOM/script.js` in your browser and navigate to the console to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We log `document.body` to access the <body> contained in the document.

  * üîë We can view all the elements nested inside the <body> by logging `document.body.children`.

  * üîë To access the first element in the body, we log `document.body.children[0]`.

  * üîë Child elements can also have children! To access an element nested in child element, we log `document.body.children[1].children[0]`.

* Open `03-Ins_Traverse-DOM/index.html` in your IDE to demonstrate the following:

  * üîë DOM Traveral allows us to access the DOM using parent-child relationships. 

  ```js
  console.log(document.body.children[1].children[0]);
  ```
  
  * üîë We can also access an element directly by targeting the id of the element using the method `.getElementbyId()`.

  ```js
  var firstChildUl = document.getElementById("first-child-ul")
  console.log(firstChildUl);
  ```

  * üîë We can set and change a selected element's style by accessing an element's style object and its properties and assigned a value.

  ```js
  firstChildUl.style.color = "green";
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use parent-child relationships to access a child element?

  * üôã We use the terms parent and child to explain how elements in the DOM are related. A parent element is an element that holds one or more children. To access the children, we first access the parent and then pass through to reach the child element we wish to select. Working your way down the DOM tree is called DOM traversal.  

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we use an element's id to access an element?

  * üôã We use the method `.getElementbyId()` to quickly access an element directly using its id. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Traverse-DOM/Unsolved/README.md`.

### 6. Student Do: DOM Traversal (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `04-Stu_Traverse-DOM/Unsolved/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

### 7. Instructor Review: DOM Traversal (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with DOM Traversal? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .getElementById()

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .children[0]

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .style.property

* Open `04-Stu_Traverse-DOM/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We use the method `.getElementById()` to select the elements with `main` and `articles` ids and store them in variables.

  ```js
  var articlesDiv = document.getElementById("articles");
  var mainDiv = document.getElementById("main");
  ```

  * üîë To access elements nested inside the `div`, we use `.children` to return a list of all the child elements. To select the first child element of the articles `div`, we use `children[0]`. This selects the article title and sets the font size.

  ```js
  articlesDiv.children[0].style.fontSize = "50px";
  ```

  * üîë The headline `"Welcome to World News"` is second child of the main `div`. We access the element's style object to set the `color` of font to be `white`.  

  ```js
  mainDiv.children[1].style.color = "white";
  ```
  
* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we set a style of an element inline using the DOM? 

  * üôã We access the element's style object and change or set a style property using the `=` assignment operator.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on ElementCSSInlineStyle.style](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementCSSInlineStyle/style), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 8. Instructor Demo: Setting Attributes (5 min) 

* Open `05-Ins_Setting-Attributes/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë All of the elements on this page have been styled in JavaScript using Web API methods.

  * üîë We select multiple elements to style using the document method `.querySelectorAll()`

  * üîë We style those elements using the element method `.setAttribute()`.

  * üîë We can also use `.setAttribute()` to set an image's source directly .

* Open `05-Ins_Setting-Attributes/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We select all the `p` and `div` tags using the `.querySelectorAll()` method and store the lists in variables.

  ```js
  var divTags = document.querySelectorAll("div");
  var pTags = document.querySelectorAll("p");
  ```
  
  * üîë We access the first element of a selector using `.querySelector()`. This method returns a single element. 

  ```js
  var changeP = document.querySelector("#change2");
  ```

  * üîë We use `.setAttribute()` to set an image's source. The method takes two parameters. The first parameter names the attribute we want to change. The second is the value we want to assign to the attribute.

  ```js
  imgEl[0].setAttribute("src", "images/image_1.png");
  ```

  * üîë We can also use `.setAttribute()` to set the style of the image.

  ```js
  imgEl[0].setAttribute("style", "width:500px; height:200px;");
  ```

  * üîë We iterate over a list of elements to apply the styling changes to all the elements in the list. 

  ```js
  for (var i = 0; i < divTags.length; i++) {
    divTags[i].setAttribute("style", "color:blue; font-size: 30px");
  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What is the difference between the document methods `.querySelector()` and `querySelectorAll()`?

  * üôã The method `.querySelectorAll()` returns a list of all of the elements that match the selector. The method `.querySelector()` returns the first match of the selector even if there are multiple matches, so only one element is returned! 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What two parameters does the method `.setAttribute()` take? 

  * üôã The method `.setAttribute()` takes two parameters. The first is the name of the attribute that we want to set or change, like `src` or `style`. The second parameter is the value you want to set. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 9. Student Do: Setting Attributes (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `06-Stu_Setting-Attributes/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

### 10. BREAK (15 min)

### 11. Instructor Review: Setting Attributes (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with setting attributes? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .querySelectorAll()

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .setAttribute()

* Open `06-Stu_Setting-Attributes/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We use `.querySelectorAll()` to select all the `h4` elements in our document. We store the list in a variable.

    ```js
    var siteTitles = document.querySelectorAll("h4");
    ```

  * üîë  We use `.setAttribute()` to set the styles for the elements. We can set multiple styles at the same time.

    ```js
    siteTitles[i].setAttribute("style", "color: blue; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 30px; padding-left:10px; margin: 0");
    ```

  * üîë We use a loop to iterate over all the `h4` elements in the list and apply the styles.

    ```js
    for (var i = 0; i < siteTitles.length; i++) {
      siteTitles[i].setAttribute("style", "color: blue; font-weight: bolder; font-size: 30px; padding-left:10px; margin: 0");
    }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Where have we seen loops before? 

  * üôã We previously used loops to iterate over a list of students' names. Now, we are using a loop to iterate over a list of HTML elements. Loops are widely used in JavaScript when we want to perform the same task over and over again and loops help us write DRY-er code. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How can we set an element's attribute? 
  
  * üôã We use `setAttribute()` methods to set or change attributes, like `style` and `src`, all using JavaScript. 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [Web Docs on Document.querySelectorAll() ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) and [Web Docs on Element.setAttribute()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute) and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 12. Instructor Demo: Create and Append (5 min) 

* Open `07-Ins_Create-Append/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë When we open the browser window, a prompt appears asking the user to enter an HTML tag. We can enter one or more elements following the prompts. 

  * üîë If valid tags are selected, a message appears indicating that the a new element was created based on the user input.

  * üîë The element and the message it contains were all created dynamically using JavaScript.

* Open `07-Ins_Create-Append/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We use the method `.createElement()` to create new elements.

  ```js
  var tag = document.createElement(tagName);
  ```

  * We use the `.textContent` property to add content to our element.

  ```js
  tag.textContent = "This was made via prompts. It's a " + tagName + ".";
  ```

  * When we create an element, it will not appear unless it is appended to another element in our HTML. We use `.appendChild()` to attach our new element as a child of the `<body>`.

  ```js
  document.body.appendChild(tag);
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è After an element is created, what additional step must we take to get our element to appear in our HTML?

  * üôã After we create an element, we must append or attach it to an existing HTML element so that the element shows up in our HTML.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `08-Stu_Append-Create/README.md`.

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with creating and appending elements? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .createElement()

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .textContent

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .appendChild()

* Open `08-Stu_Append-Create/Solved/script.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * üîë We create the ordered list element using `.createElement()`.

    ```js
    var listEl = document.createElement("ol");
    ```

  * The ordered list has four child list elements. We use `.createElement()` to create each list item and store the elements in a variable.

  ```js
  var li1 = document.createElement("li");
  var li2 = document.createElement("li");
  var li3 = document.createElement("li");
  var li4 = document.createElement("li");
  ```

  * üîë We add text to the list elements using the `.textContent` property.

  ```js
  li1.textContent = "Apples üçé ";
  li2.textContent = "Pizza üçï ";
  li3.textContent = "Dumplings ü•ü ";
  li4.textContent = "Cupcakes üßÅ ";
  ```

  * üîë We append the ordered list element as a child of the `<div>` that contains the text `My favorite foods are:" using `.appendChild()`

  ```js
  favoriteEl.appendChild(listEl);
  ```

  * üîë We then append the list items as a child of the ordered list element. This attaches the elements to the HTML document.

  ```js
  listEl.appendChild(li1);
  listEl.appendChild(li2);
  listEl.appendChild(li3);
  listEl.appendChild(li4);
  ```

  * We add styling to the ordered list element and child list items using `.setAttribute()`.

  ```js
  listEl.setAttribute("style", "background:#333333; padding:20px;");
  li1.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #666666; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
  li2.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #777777; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
  li3.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #888888; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
  li4.setAttribute("style", " color:white; background: #999999; padding: 5px; margin-left: 35px;");
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why do we append the list items to the ordered list element `<ol>` and not just the `<body>`?

  * üôã It is important to think about the the parent-child relationships when appending elements to the DOM. An ordered list is made up of the ordered list <ol> element and its child <li> list items. So, we maintain that relationship by attaching the list items as children of the ordered list. If we attached the list items to the `<body>`, the list items' parent would be the <body> which is not what we want! 

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on Document.createElement()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createElement) and [MDN Web Docs on Node.appendChild()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 15. Instructor Demo: Timers and Intervals (5 min) 

* Open `09-Ins_Timers-Intervals/index.html` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We can use JavaScript to create a countdown timer by evaluating an expression at a set interval.

  * üîë The interval will continue until it is cleared. Here it is cleared when the countdown reaches zero. The colorsplosion image then appears.

* Open `09-Ins_Timers-Intervals/script.js` in your IDE and demonstrate the following:

  * üîë We store the interval in a variable. We use this variable name to clear the interval when we want the action to stop. 

  ```js
  var timerInterval = setInterval(function() {...}, 1000)
  ```

  * üîë The `.setInterval()` method takes a function as its first argument and a number representing the number of milliseconds as the second argument

  ```js
  setInterval(function() {
    secondsLeft--;
    timeEl.textContent = secondsLeft + " seconds left till colorsplosion.";

    if(secondsLeft === 0) {
      clearInterval(timerInterval);
      sendMessage();
    }

  }, 1000);
  ```

  * üîë The function is the action we want to be evaluated at each interval. This function prints a message at each interval if the number seconds left is greater than zero.  

  ```js
  function() {
    secondsLeft--;
    timeEl.textContent = secondsLeft + " seconds left till colorsplosion.";

    if(secondsLeft === 0) {
      clearInterval(timerInterval);
      sendMessage();
    }
  ```

  * üîë When the countdown reaches zero, the `clearInterval()` method is called to stop the countdown. 

   ```js
   clearInterval(timerInterval);
   ```

  * üîë The second argument is the interval. Since intervals use milliseconds, we use `1000` to create an interval of one second.

  ```js
   }, 1000);
  ```

  * üîë  The code to create and append the image element is inside the `sendMessage` function. By calling `sendMessage()` after the interval is cleared, the image will pop up after the countdown is complete. 

  ```js
  function sendMessage() {
  timeEl.textContent = " ";

  var imgEl = document.createElement("img");

  imgEl.setAttribute("src", "images/image_1.jpg");
  mainEl.appendChild(imgEl);

  }
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è Why do we need to use `.clearInterval()`?

  * üôã The method `.setInterval()` only sets up the interval for the code to execute, so it will keep going and going until we tell it to stop. The method `.clearInterval()` stops the action from performing. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Timers-Intervals/README.md`.

### 16. Student Do: Timers and Intervals (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `10-Stu_Timers-Intervals/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# üèóÔ∏è Create a Speed Reader

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a speed reading application that prints a single word of a poem one word at a time. The word should change at the interval provided by the user.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when after the countdown ends, words to the provided poem appear on the screen one at a time at the interval provided by the user.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![]()

## üí° Hints

What property can be used add text to an HTML element with JavaScript?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What window method is used to delay an action for a set number of milliseconds? Why might this method be useful?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students who need extra help.

### 17. Instructor Review: Timers and Intervals (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è How comfortable do you feel with timers and intervals? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (üîë) below to review the following key points:

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .setInterval()

  * ‚úîÔ∏è .clearInterval()

* Open `@TODO/folder/file` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * We append the element that will contain our poetry text using `.appendChild()`.

  ```js
   mainEl.appendChild(bodyEl);
  ```

 * We store the interval in a variable. We will later use this variable name to clear the interval.

 ```js
 var poemInterval = setInterval(function() {
 ```

 * üîë We set the first argument of `.setInterval()` to be the action we want to have performed at each interval.

 * üîë If all the words have printed to the screen at the given interval, then we use `clearInterval()` to stop the action.

 ```js
 if (words[i] === undefined) {
      clearInterval(poemInterval);
    }
  ```

 * Else, if words remain, we use the `.textContent` property to set the text of the `<div>` to the current word. 

 ```js
  else {
      mainEl.textContent = words[i];
      i++;
    }
 
 ```
* We set the interval to equal the value stored in the variable `millisecondsPerWord` which is the number entered by the user at the prompt.

```js
}, millisecondsPerWord);
```

* Ask the class the following questions (‚òùÔ∏è) and call on students for the answers (üôã):

  * ‚òùÔ∏è @TODO { DO WE END OUR REVIEWS WITH A QUESTION? }

  * üôã @TODO { YES, WE DO! }

  * ‚òùÔ∏è What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * üôã @TODO We can refer to supplemental material, read the [{ DOCS }]({ URL }), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before ending the class.

// LAST ACTIVITY
### 14. Instructor Do: Timers and Intervals (10 mins)

* Executing code on a timer or interval allows us to set some amount of time to pass between functionality.

* Ask the class, "Where are timers used in applications?"

  * Countdowns

  * Calendars

  * Games

* Navigate to [08-Ins_Timers-Intervals](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/08-Ins_Timers-Intervals) and open the `index.html` in your browser. Demo the application to students and point out the following:

  * After the countdown completes, an image is loaded to the browser all without user interaction.

* Ask the class, "What allowed us to do this?"

  * The `setInterval` function allows us to complete code after a specific amount of time has passed.

* Navigate to [08-Ins_Timers-Intervals script.js](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/08-Ins_Timers-Intervals/script.js) and open it in your IDE. Explain the following points to students:

  * First we declare our `setInterval` function and assign it to a variable. We will get to why we store it in a variable at the end.

  ```js
  var timerInterval = setInterval(function() {
  ```

  * Next, we decrement our `secondsLeft` variable that we initially set to `10`.

  ```js
  secondsLeft--;
  ```

  * As each second passes we set the textContent of our `timeEl` to display the `secondsLeft` variable concatenated with a string. If our `secondsLeft` is 0, we then `clearInterval` and execute our `sendMessage` function.

  ```js
  timeEl.textContent = secondsLeft + " seconds left till colorsplosion.";
  if(secondsLeft === 0) {
    clearInterval(timerInterval);
    sendMessage();
  }
  ```

* Sometimes programmers want functionality to happen after a set period of time, and not all right away. We use timers to achieve this result.

* `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are two methods that allow for us to execute code based on time.

  * These two methods are actually above the `document` object and are attached directly to the `window`.

* When using either of these timer methods, The first parameter is a function to be executed. The second parameter indicates the amount of time in milliseconds before execution.

  ```js
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log("complete");
  }, 1000);

  setInterval(function(){
    console.log("this will show every second");
  }, 1000)
  ```

* `setTimeout` will execute the body of the function one time, once the allotted amount of time has passed.

  * `setInterval` will execute the body of the function every X amount of milliseconds as specified in the second argument to the `setInterval` function.

* Ask the class why they think we might need to clear an interval that we started.

  * If we do not `clearInterval`, the interval would continue to run indefinitely. We stored our `setInterval` function in a variable so we could pass that instance into our `clearInterval`, stopping execution.

  * `setTimeout` has its own method for stopping execution, `clearTimeout`.

* Answer any questions students may have about the demo. 

### 15. Student Do: Speed Reader (20 mins)

* Direct students to the final activity of class, in [09-Stu_SpeedReader](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/09-Stu_SpeedReader/Unsolved).

```md
# Speed Reader 

In this activity you are going to create a speed reading application. It will input a single word on the screen at a time, changing to the next word after 1 second. This equates to reading at 60 Words Per Minute (WPM).

## Instructions

* The app should countdown from 5, and when the countdown is finished it should print one word to the screen every second. Each word replaces the other.

* Open `index.html` and create the necessary HTML. You will need at least 3 elements.

* Open `script`.

  * The two function names have been created for you, as well as a poem to speed read.

* Fill out the necessary code that would create a countdown timer. When that timer completes, it should dissapear and speed reading should begin.
```

### 16. Instructor Do: Review Speed Reader (10 mins)

* Navigate to [09-Stu_SpeedReader/Solved](../../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/01-Activities/09-Stu_SpeedReader/Solved)

* Open the solved `script` file and show students the completed solution.

* Point out these main points to students:

  * In our `prepareRead` function we store our interval in a variable so we can clear it later.

  ```js
  var timeInterval = setInterval(function() {
  ```

  * When the timer has run out, we empty the `textContent` of the `timerEl` and then execute our `speedRead` function.

  ```js
  if (timeLeft === 0) {
    timerEl.textContent = " ";
    speedRead();
    clearInterval(timeInterval);
  }
  ```

  * We used a prompt to ask the user to enter the speed at which they would like to read, we passed that response in as the second argument of our `speedRead` setInterval.

  ```js
  }, speed);
  ```

   * As opposed to a fixed value, i.e.,

   ```js
   }, 1000);
   ```

  * In the beginning of our `speedRead` function we append our `bodyEl`, generated via `createElement`, to the `mainEl` of our HTML page.

  ```js
  mainEl.append(bodyEl);
  ```

  * We use an `if` statement to check whether the piece we are reading is over. When `words[i]` begins to evaluate to undefined and not a word, we terminate the interval via `clearInterval`. As long as `words[i]` evaluates to a word from our array, we make the content of our `mainEl` reflect that.

  ```js
  if (words[i] === undefined) {
    clearInterval(poemInterval);
  } else {
    mainEl.textContent = words[i];
    i++;
  }
  ```
