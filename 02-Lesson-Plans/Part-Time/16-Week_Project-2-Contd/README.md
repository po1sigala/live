# Unit 16 Instructor Overview: Project 2 Continued

## Overview

In this unit, students will continue to work on their second project and present their projects to the class at the end of the unit. They'll also begin to revise their professional materials, including their portfolios, and add their projects once they've completed them.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Heads-Up

Before next unit, make sure you install both MongoDB and Robo 3T on your machine. Although there is time set aside in class for students to install MongoDB, encourage them to install it prior to class using the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb).

If you haven't used MongoDB much in the past, take a look at next week's queries and solutions.
