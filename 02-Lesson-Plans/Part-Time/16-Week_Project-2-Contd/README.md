# Unit 16: Project-2-Contd

## Overview

In this unit, we will continue to work on project 2, with presentations on the third day.

  * Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before project day presentations.

### Regional Content

At the start of this unit, you will add regional content to the class-specific repo.

The four programming languages included in Regional content are Java, C#, PHP, and Python. Each folder contains its own Power Pack, a unit of async content for that programming language. These folders are located [here](../../../01-Class-Content/25-Power-Packs/).

Because this content is asynchronous, you wonâ€™t teach it during your class. You will provide it to students by uploading it to the class-specific repo.

This content is self-paced, self-guided, and designed to help students continue to learn new skills after their boot camp has ended. It will also allow them to keep coding and stay engaged while they search for their first developer role. You should remind students that in order to be employer-competitive, it is important that they continuously add new skills and technologies to their knowledge base.

## Heads Up

Before next unit, make sure you install MongoDB and Robo 3T on your machine--you'll need both.

If you haven't used MongoDB much in the past, take a look at next week's queries and solutions. This should prime you for the lecture.

## Career Connection
Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [supplemental folder](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/04-Important/CAREER-CONNECTION.md).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).
