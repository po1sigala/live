# Unit 16 Instructor Overview: Project 2 Continued

## Overview

In this unit, students will continue to work on their second project and present their projects to the class at the end of the unit. They'll also begin to revise their professional materials, including their portfolios, and add their projects once they've completed them.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_u8TKy5zW5UlrVQVnyDEZ0unGI2tjQPDEpA0FNuBKAw/edit) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, you'll be taking a look at how computer science relates to what students have learned so far with JavaScript. We recommend that you take a moment to review topics that pertain to data structures, JavaScript event loop, and closures. Keep in mind that these topics can be hard for students to grasp but it is important to learn because the students will be faced with it during the interview phase of any software job.
