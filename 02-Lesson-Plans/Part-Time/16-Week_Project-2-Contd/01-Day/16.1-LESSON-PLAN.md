# 16.1 Part-Time Lesson Plan: Project 2

## Overview

In this class students will continue to work on their second project.

## Instructor Notes

* No classroom instruction today.

* You will assume the role of 'scrummaster' and hold standing meetings with each group. The purpose of these scrums is to: 

  1. Gauge progress on projects

  2. Course correct if scope creeps or focus shifts

  3. Most importantly, hold students accountable. Participation is a requirement for receipt of a passing grade. 

* Ask each student the following questions: 

  * What did you accomplish?

  * What are your goals?

  * Are there any obstacles?

## Learning Objectives

* To provide students more time and support for their group projects.
