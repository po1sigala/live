# Unit 03 & 04 Instructor Overview: JavaScript and Web APIs

## Overview

In Unit 03, you will introduce students to the fundamentals of JavaScript, including variables, primitive types, arrays, and objects. You will also use logical and comparison operators to construct conditional statements and guide students as they write their first functions and algorithms. 

In Unit 04, students will be introduced to the Document Object Model (DOM) and gain experience using Web APIs to manipulate the DOM. Students will also handle click events using `addEventListener()`, work with keyboard events like `keyup` and `keydown`, and use local and session storage.

Refer to the Class Content Unit Overview for [Unit 03](../../../01-Class-Content/03-JavaScript/README.md) and [Unit 04](../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo before every class and to have that day's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* This will be some students' first introduction to programming fundamentals and the JavaScript language. Assure students that they will use the skills they learn this week again and again, and the syntax will become more familiar with practice. 

* This is also a good opportunity for students to practice pseudocoding. Encourage students to talk through difficult activities in plain language with their partner. This will help them to not only reinforce their fundamental understanding of JavaScript but also build the problem-solving skills that JavaScript demands. 

* Take a few minutes before class to familiarize yourself with the various ways to access [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open) on different machines, so that you can talk students through opening up the console on Mac and Windows operating systems.

* The lessons this week cover a lot of new material. But each activity builds on the previous ones, so remind students that if they feel overwhelmed, they can look back at past activities for guidance. 

* Unit 04 Homework will bring together the key concepts covered in the activities and require students to use both intervals and local storage. However, the students will also need to research and use Web APIs not explicitly introduced in the activities. Explain to students that the methods from class represent just a few of the many options for manipulating the DOM.

* Be ready to view and edit local storage and session storage key-value pairs in Chrome DevTools. If you need a quick refresher, refer to the [Google documentation on viewing and editing local storage with Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/localstorage) and the [Google documentation on viewing and editing session storage with Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/sessionstorage).

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career services material can be found in their Career Connection folder for [Unit 03](../../../01-Class-Content/03-JavaScript/04-Career-Connection/README.md) and [Unit 04](../../../01-Class-Content/04-Web-APIs/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career services, visit the [Career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/).

## Heads-Up

* Students may come across jQuery solutions when searching for DOM and event resources. Let them know that we will cover jQuery in Unit 05. For now, advise them not to consult resources that mention jQuery or the `$` variable.

* In Unit 06, we will work with Server-Side APIs. It is recommended that you try to fill any conceptual holes students have about JavaScript objects this unit.
