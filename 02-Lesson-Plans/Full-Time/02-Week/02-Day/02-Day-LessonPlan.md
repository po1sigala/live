# 02.2 Lesson Plan - Jumping for JavaScript (10:00 AM) <!--links--> &nbsp; [⬅️](../01-Day/01-Day-LessonPlan.md) &nbsp; [➡️](../03-Day/03-Day-LessonPlan.md)

## Overview 

Today's class is focused on re-introducing students to the concept of `for` loops and of how they can be used in combination with arrays, if/else statements, and other common programming tools to create a Rock-Paper-Scissors game. We will be introducing students to the concept of JavaScript Functions.

## Instructor Notes

* `Summary: Complete Activities 19-27 in Unit 03`

* In today's class, you will be recapping the concept of `for` loops, the concept of combining arrays, conditionals, and user inputs to create more sophisticated JavaScript applications. Much of what students have learned to date will culminate in the last activity of the day where they will work together to build a rock-paper-scissors game.

* Today's lesson plan is packed to the brim with activities. Realistically assess your usual pace; if you are an instructor who tends to fall behind, skip activities which say "TIME PERMITTING" on the slides. If you tend to speak and present at a fast pace, take the time to complete as many of these exercises as you like. Alternatively, you can always just show students the solutions to these activities in live demos, and then Slack them the answers. Just BE SURE to leave around 1 hour of class time for students to work on the rock-paper-scissors activity. This activity is extremely important, and it's a close match to their homework assignment.

* Students should be given a substantial amount of time to complete the rock-paper-scissors activity. They will not have been given everything they need to complete the activity. The idea is for students to become more comfortable with the idea of working without knowing _everything_. Reveal bits of the solution using the code in the `23-RPS-Coded` directory while students are working. Throughout class, show these bits of the solution on the projector, and try to help guide students through the problem.

* **Note**: Even if you don't cover an activity in class, still include it in the list of activities you share into your local repo. Students will be able to look back at these activities on their own time.

## Class Objectives

* To use `for` loops, arrays, and conditional logic to create a rock-paper-scissors game.

### 1. Instructor Do: Welcome Students (5 mins)

* Welcome students to class and let them know the schedule for today. Then begin their first activity.

### 2. Students Do: Another Loop (10 mins)

* If you are AHEAD of schedule and feel like students could benefit from another example, Slack out the following instructions.

  * **Instructions**

    * Starting from scratch, create a `for` loop that console logs the following lines:
      ```
      I am 0
      I am 1
      I am 2
      I am 3
      I am 4
      ```
    * Don't use an array!

### 14. Instructor Do: Review Activity (5 mins)

* Review `another-loop-solved.html` in `19-AnotherLoop/Solution`.

  * Point out that in this case, the iterator is not an array length but an integer.

  * Point out that the length is **one less than** the final number desired.

* Then Slack out `another-loop-solved.html`
