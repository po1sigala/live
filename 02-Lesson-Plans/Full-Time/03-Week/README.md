# Week 03: Third-Party-APIs & Server-side APIs

## Overview

When developers find themselves repeating a task, they tend to look for a way to simplify their workflow. We saw earlier how CSS frameworks were developed to ensure consistency across applications and to expedite developer workflows. Tools with similar goals have emerged in the JavaScript ecosystem. 

jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling. It allows us to write fewer lines of code than we'd need to if we were using plain ol' JavaScript to accomplish the same end. jQuery also provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs.

Some argue that jQuery is slowly being phased out and replaced with front-end frameworks such as React. You might not see as many job listings for jQuery developers, but it’s an important skill to master as the library is still widely used in both new and legacy code. 

Also this week we will learn the Fetch web API which can data from server-side APIs, like the OpenWeather API.

We'll use the `fetch()` method to make requests, parse through the returned datasets, and convert them to HTML elements. We'll explore how this data is typically formatted, how to look for and handle errors that might arise, and more importantly, how to read documentation when working with server-side APIs.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* In this unit's classes, expect students to have many issues with jQuery syntax. Be encouraging and let them know that the syntax will seem more intuitive over time. For now, they should just try to utilize the syntax as is.

* Student's will also gain their first exposure to Bootstrap, so be prepared for numerous questions surrounding that. Head over to the [Docs on Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) to familiarize yourself.

* Starting this unit, slides will play a less prominent role. Warn students of this and let them know that their time spent coding is where real learning will happen.

* The MDN Web Docs use ES6 in their Fetch API examples, but our activities will continue to use ES5 syntax, because that is what students will be familiar with. We will cover ES6 syntax in Unit 09, so until then, our activities will continue to use ES5 syntax.

* Along with the Fetch API, students will also briefly experiment with cURL, `XMLHttpRequest` objects, and `$.ajax()`.

* Students will use the GitHub API for activities and the OpenWeather API for their homework. The OpenWeather API requires signing up for a key.

* Remind students to complete this unit's assessment near the end of the week. Students can find it in the Unit Overview under Technical Interview Preparation.

## Heads-Up

For the next two units, students will work on their first group project. Groups should consist of three to four students each. Don't let students work on a project alone, as this is one of their only chances to learn proper Git collaboration.
