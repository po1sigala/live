# 9.4 Lesson Plan - PWAs (6:30 PM)

## Overview

Today's class will continue our journey into web performance by learning about progressive web apps. We will start with our basic Gallery App and step by step, implement a web app manifest as well as a service worker. This new functionality will provide us with a fully functioning progressive web app that delivers an offline experience to our users.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `05-Stu_Gallery-Lazy-Load` through `16-Stu_Notetaker-PWA`.

* You may need to clear your storage periodically in order to see each iteration of activities. Do so in DevTools under `Application > Clear storage > Clear site data`.

* Some of today's activities use mongoDB to store data. It is recommended that you open a separate tab in your terminal and run `mongod`. Don't forget to kill the process at the end of class.

* It is recommended that you take some time to familiarize yourself with service workers before class begins. Specifically, look over the service worker lifecycle and caching and returning requests at https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers/.


## Learning Objectives

* Explain the benefits a progressive web app offers a user over a traditional app.

* Implement and explain the role of a web app manifest.

* Implement and explain the role of a service worker.
