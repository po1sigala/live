# Unit 01-02: HTML-Git and Advanced-CSS

## Overview

In this unit, we will be welcoming our students to their first unit of our Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp. We'll be walking them through the very basics of HTML/CSS, Git Version Control, and Terminal/Console commands.

We'll also continue diving into CSS and providing students with a thorough series on Bootstrap. Additionally, we'll cover deployments with GitHub Pages.

Refer to the following links for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework:

## Instructor / TA Notes

First off, welcome and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors/TAs like yourself, we're helping hundreds of students across the world achieve their career goals and their creative dreams. You have plenty of time to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Buckle in! You're in for a fun ride!

* Also during the first class, you will review the tools that students will need in this course, including Slack, VS Code, and GitHub. Refer to the [Slack workspace set-up guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace), the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and the [GitHub Docs on setting up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) to review set-up and installation on both Windows and Mac machines.

* Remind students that they can always refer to their prework for more detailed installation instructions. However, if a student is struggling to install or use the required tools, encourage them to stay for office hours for additional help.

* In addition to HTML, CSS, and Git fundamentals, the activities for this week also aim to familiarize students with classroom expectations. Make sure to emphasize the importance of doing a `git pull` of the class repo before each class. 

* For the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, be prepared to demonstrate configuring the local Git default branch to `main` as well as creating a Git repository using `git init`. You might want to review [Git Basicsâ€”Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) ahead of time to prepare for student questions that might arise. 

Also, Make sure to remind students that although CSS is a broad language with many tricks to learn, they will continue to build their CSS knowledge throughout the entire course.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their Career Connection folder for [Unit 01](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Important/CAREER-CONNECTION.md) and [Unit 02](../../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](https://mycareerspot.org/).

## Heads Up

A lot of time will be spent ensuring that students have properly installed all of the tools and programs from the prework.

Be ready to have your troubleshooting hat on for helping students debug GitHub Pages deploys, as the surface area for problems is somewhat large.

Next unit, we begin JavaScript, make sure to review the slide decks in advance.

Next unit we will also provide students with common problems they will see in interviews. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these problems so that you can help students with any questions they might have.

> **IMPORTANT** Be sure to give your students both the [Good README Guide](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Important/Good-README-Guide/README.md) and the [Homework Guide](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Important/Homework-Guide/README.md) during the first week of class.
