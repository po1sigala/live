# Unit 01-02: HTML-Git and Advanced-CSS

## Overview

In this unit, we will be welcoming our students to their first unit of our Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp. We'll be walking them through the very basics of HTML/CSS, Git Version Control, and Terminal/Console commands.

We'll also continue diving into CSS and providing students with a thorough series on Bootstrap. Additionally, we'll cover deployments with GitHub Pages.

## Instructor / TA Notes

First off, welcome and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors/TAs like yourself, we're helping hundreds of students across the world achieve their career goals and their creative dreams. You have plenty of time to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Buckle in! You're in for a fun ride!

The main goal of this unit is to help students get adjusted to an "average day" of our bootcamp. Be sure to encourage students plenty and focus heavily on keeping students engaged. This unit is crucial in setting the tone for units to come.

In this unit, students will learn how to build web apps that incorporate both of these features: responsive web design and advanced CSS. These skills are a must for modern web developers, and learning them will enable you to create attractive, engaging, and adaptive websites. 

Also, Make sure to remind students that although CSS is a broad language with many tricks to learn, they will continue to build their CSS knowledge throughout the entire course.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their Career Connection folder for [Unit 01](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Important/CAREER-CONNECTION.md) and [Unit 02](../../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

## Heads Up

A lot of time will be spent ensuring that students have properly installed all of the tools and programs from the prework.

Be ready to have your troubleshooting hat on for helping students debug GitHub Pages deploys, as the surface area for problems is somewhat large.

Next unit, we begin JavaScript, make sure to review the slide decks in advance.

Next unit we will also provide students with common problems they will see in interviews. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with these problems so that you can help students with any questions they might have.

> **IMPORTANT** Be sure to give your students both the [Good README Guide](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Important/Good-README-Guide/README.md) and the [Homework Guide](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Important/Homework-Guide/README.md) during the first week of class.
