# Unit 01-02: HTML-Git-CSS

## Overview

In this week, we will be welcoming our students to their first week of our Full-Stack Web Development Boot Camp. We'll be walking them through the very basics of HTML/CSS, Git Version Control, and Terminal/Console commands.

We'll also continue diving into CSS and providing students with a thorough series on Bootstrap. Additionally, we'll cover deployments with GitHub Pages.

## Instructor / TA Notes

First off, welcome and thank you so much for being a part of our program! Thanks to instructors/TAs like yourself, we're helping hundreds of students across the world achieve their career goals and their creative dreams. You have plenty of time to work with these students, and their progress will astound you. Buckle in! You're in for a fun ride!

The main goal of this week is to help students get adjusted to an "average day" of our bootcamp. Be sure to encourage students plenty and focus heavily on keeping students engaged. This week is crucial in setting the tone for weeks to come.

Also, Make sure to remind students that although CSS is a broad language with many tricks to learn, they will continue to build their CSS knowledge throughout the entire course.

## Heads Up

A lot of time will be spent ensuring that students have properly installed all of the tools and programs from the prework.

Be ready to have your troubleshooting hat on for helping students debug GitHub Pages deploys, as the surface area for problems is somewhat large.

Next week, we begin JavaScript, make sure to review the slide decks in advance.
