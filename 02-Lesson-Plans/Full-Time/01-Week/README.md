# Unit 01 & 02 Instructor Overview: HTML, CSS, and Git and Advanced CSS

## Overview

In Unit 01, you will introduce students to HTML, CSS, and version control with Git.

In Unit 02, students will implement media queries and flexbox to create a responsive web design. Students will also overwrite browser defaults by using a CSS reset and then rebuild those styles using advanced CSS concepts, such as pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements.

Refer to the Class Content Unit Overview for [Unit 01](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/README.md) and [Unit 02](../../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* During the first 70 minutes of the first class, the university will lead introductory activities and provide important course-specific information to the students. 

* Also during the first class, you will review the tools that students will need in this course, including Slack, VS Code, and GitHub. Refer to the [Slack workspace set-up guide](https://slack.com/help/articles/212675257-Join-a-Slack-workspace), the [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and the [GitHub Docs on setting up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) to review set-up and installation on both Windows and Mac machines.

* Remind students that they can always refer to their prework for more detailed installation instructions. However, if a student is struggling to install or use the required tools, encourage them to stay for office hours for additional help.

* In addition to HTML, CSS, and Git fundamentals, the activities for this week also aim to familiarize students with classroom expectations. Make sure to emphasize the importance of doing a `git pull` of the class repo before each class. 

* For the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, be prepared to demonstrate configuring the local Git default branch to `main` as well as creating a Git repository using `git init`. You might want to review [Git Basics—Getting a Git Repository](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) ahead of time to prepare for student questions that might arise. 

* The mini-project builds on the fundamental HTML and CSS concepts covered this week. Students will each work on their own projects, but they will be put into groups so that they can brainstorm together and share their learnings. This will be the first of many opportunities for them to collaborate in groups.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo before every class and to have that day's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* Be ready to use Chrome DevTools and the device emulator to quickly demonstrate various CSS concepts on different screen sizes.

* Make sure to remind students that CSS is a broad language with many tricks to learn. They shouldn't expect to learn it all in one week. In fact, they will continue to build their CSS knowledge throughout the entire course.

* When learning about typography, students will probably see different fonts on their machines depending on the operating system they're using. Therefore, be prepared to discuss web-safe fonts and font fallbacks.

* Remind students to complete the assessments for both units near the end of the week. Students can find them in their Unit Overviews under Technical Interview Preparation.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their Career Connection folder for [Unit 01](../../../01-Class-Content/01-HTML-Git-CSS/04-Career-Connection/README.md) and [Unit 02](../../../01-Class-Content/02-Advanced-CSS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

## Heads Up

* Next week, you will introduce students to JavaScript. This may be a big leap for some students. Be prepared to answer a lot of questions and be available during office hours. 

* Starting with the next unit, students will be solving algorithms that they are likely to see in technical interviews. It is recommended that you familiarize yourself with the weekly algorithm problems, so you can help students with any questions they might have&mdash;they're sure to have some!
