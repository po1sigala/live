## 5.2 - Node and ES6 (10:00 AM)

## Overview

In this class, we will be building on students' proficiency with Node by introducing them to additional ES6 features that they will be using in Node.

## Instructor Notes 

@TODO
* Complete activities `31-Stu_Callback-Review` through `40-Stu_Mini-Project`

* While you would have naturally explained Promises and asynchronous behavior on a need to know basis before today, now is the time to dive deep and provide more thorough instruction for these topics.

* The most important concept for students to walk away from today understanding better is Promises. If they struggle to understand async/await, assure them that a deeper understanding of Promises makes async/await easier to grasp.

* Congratulate the class on any wins today, many JavaScript developers working in the field are unable to accurately explain many of the topics we'll be covering.

## Learning Objectives

* Identify and implement how and when to use arrow functions
* Identify and implement how and when to use let and const variables
* Identify and destructuring of arrays, functions and objects in ES6
