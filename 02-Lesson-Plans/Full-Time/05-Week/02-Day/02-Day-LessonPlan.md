# 05.2 Full-Time Lesson Plan: Node.js

## Overview 

In this lesson, we will take a deeper dive into the world that is Node.js. We will explore how to take advantage of native modules that come built into Node.js itself. We will access the file system, pass command-line arguments into applications, get acquainted with Node Package Manager, and finally build CLI apps using a package called `inquirer`.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `15-Ins_Modularization` through `27-Evr_Git-Fork`.

* Explain to students that npm works much like embedding a CDN link for a framework directly in the HTML, only we will download it into the project and store it in a folder called `node_modules`.

* At this point students should have both Node.js and npm installed. To ensure that npm is installed properly, instruct students to visit the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* This lesson covers some concepts that you might want to review to prepare for student questions:

  * [MDN Web Docs on for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of)

  * [MDN Web Docs on spread syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

  * [MDN Web Docs on destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

* If the students struggle with the `Everyone Do: Git` activity, walk through it with the students using the talking points provided. Otherwise, support the students as they do the activity and do a brief review at the end.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Initialize projects and install third-party modules like `inquirer` using npm.

* Use dependencies and investigate the content of `package.json`.

* Identify and implement how and when to use `for...of` loops.

* Identify and implement how and when to use the spread and rest operators.

* Use destructuring assignment syntax to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into unique variables.

* Identify and implement how and when to fork a Git repository.

### 1. Instructor Demo: Modularization (5 min) 

* Welcome students to class. Ask if anyone has any questions before starting the first activity.

* Open the `15-Ins_Modularization` directory in your IDE.

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 We see the following output of this file: 

  ```sh
  apple
  1
  ```

* 🔑  We are importing a dependency, `badmath`, and logging the results of `badmath.pie` and `badmath.predictable`, as follows: 

  ```js
  var badmath = require("./badmath.js");

  console.log(badmath.pie);

  console.log(badmath.predictable());
  ```

* Open the `15-Ins_Modularization/badmath.js` file and explain the following:

  * We declare a `pie` and `predictable` variables, as follows:

  ```js
  var pie = "apple";

  var predictable = function(){
    return 1;
  }
  ```

  * 🔑 We export the `pie` and `predictable` variables as an object stored in `module.exports`, as shown in the following example:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    pie: pie,
    predictable: predictable
  };
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What is referenced by the keyword `module`?

  * 🙋 The file `badmath.js`.

  * ☝️ Where can we look t o learn more about `module.exports`?

  * 🙋 To learn more, we can read the [Node.js documentation on module.exports](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_module_exports).

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Maths/README.md`.

### 2. Student Do: Modularization (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `16-Stu_Maths/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# 🐛 Implement Modules

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should be able to import and use the `maths.js` module to execute simple math operations.

## Expected Behavior

* When I run `node index.js sum 3 4` in the command line, it should print out `7`

* When I run `node index.js difference 3 4` in the command line, it should print out `-1`

* When I run `node index.js product 3 4` in the command line, it should print out `12`

* When I run `node index.js quotient 3 4` in the command line, it should print out `0.75`

## Actual Behavior

* Nothing happens when I run the commands because the `index.js` file is empty

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Navigate to the `Unsolved` folder in the command line.

2. Run `node index.js sum 3 4` in the command line.

## 💡 Hints

What will the `parseInt()` method allow us to do?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can you export functions and objects directly?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 3. Instructor Review: Modularization (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with modularization? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `module.exports`

  * ✔️ `require(...)`

  * ✔️ `process.argv`

* Open `16-Stu_Maths/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 This exercise combines the concepts of `process.argv` with the idea of `module.exports`.

  * 🔑 We exported an object containing all the math methods like `sum()`, `difference()`, `product()`, and `quotient()`.

  * We capture the exported object on the other side by using a `require` statement at the top of the file.

  * When we run the following commands, we can see the output of each math operation at the command prompt:

  ```sh
  node index.js sum 3 4
  node index.js difference 3 4
  node index.js product 3 4
  node index.js quotient 3 4
  ```

  * We import the `maths` module and declare three variables (`operation`, `numOne`, and `numTwo`) to store the values passed to `process.argv` from the command line, as follows:

  ```js
  const maths = require('./maths');

  const operation = process.argv[2];

  const numOne = parseInt(process.argv[3]);
  const numTwo = parseInt(process.argv[4]);
  ```

  * We use a `switch` statement to evaluate the `operation` case and call the corresponding method from the `maths` module, as shown in the following code:

  ```js
  switch (operation) {
    case 'sum':
      console.log(maths.sum(numOne, numTwo));
      break;
    case 'difference':
      console.log(maths.difference(numOne, numTwo));
      break;
    case 'product':
      console.log(maths.product(numOne, numTwo));
      break;
    case 'quotient':
      console.log(maths.quotient(numOne, numTwo));
      break;
    default:
      console.log('Check your maths!');
  }
  ```

  * 🔑  Open `16-Stu_Maths/Solved/maths.js` and show that we export the methods directly by declaring them inside of the `exports` object, as follows:

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    sum: (a, b) => a + b,
    difference: (a, b) => a - b,
    product: (a, b) => a * b,
    quotient: (a, b) => a / b,
  };
  ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we need to use `parseInt` when getting the numbers from the command line?

  * 🙋 To perform math operations in code, the data type for those numbers has to be a number.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 4. Instructor Demo: Node Package Manager (npm) (5 min) 

* Run `17-Ins-npm/npm/index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑  When we run this JavaScript file with Node.js, we will see an error message of `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`.

  * 🔑  We will also see the error message `Error: Cannot find module 'badmath'`, referring to the module we are attempting to import on line one of `index.js`, shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const badmath = require('badmath');
    ```

  * To resolve this issue, we would need to initialize npm inside this repository. This will create a `package.json` file that will keep track of which packages are needed to use the project properly. We can do this by running the following commands :

    ```sh
    npm init -y
    npm i badmath
    ```

  * 🔑 The `-y` flag tells npm to answer "yes" to each question it normally asks during the init process, to save us some time. 

  * The second command, `npm i`, is shorthand for `npm install`. These two commands can be used interchangeably. `npm i badmath` will reach out to npm's registry and install the latest version of the package you named after the command. In this case, you are installing `badmath`. 
 
* Open the `17-Ins-npm/init` folder to examine the additional file. 

  * 🔑  You will notice a difference immediately. This folder comes with a `package.json` file. This describes the repository itself as well as any scripts, dependencies, and licenses associated with the project.

  * 🔑  We can also see when we examine the content of the `package.json` file that one of the required dependencies is `badmath`, as shown in the following example:

    ```json
    "dependencies": {
        "badmath": "^1.0.1"
    },
    ```

  * Running `npm install` inside `17-Ins-npm/init` will instruct npm to examine the content of the `package.json` and install anything listed in the dependencies section.
  
  * 🔑 You will also notice a `package-lock.json` file that gets created. This keeps track of specific version numbers, but for the most part we don't need to interact with this file in any way.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we make our own `package.json` file?

  * 🙋 We would run `npm init`.
  
  * ☝️ What can we do if there is already a `package.json` in a project we have cloned?

  * 🙋 We can run `npm install` to get all the needed dependencies.
  
  * ☝️ Where can we find out what other npm commands are available?

  * 🙋 We can review the [npm documentation on CLI commands](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli-documentation/).

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu-Package-npm/README.md`.

### 5. Student Do: package.json and npm (15 min)

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `18-Stu-Package-npm/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

```md
# 📖 Initialize Projects using Node Package Manager (npm)

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to keep track of dependencies using `npm`. 

* As a developer, I want to initialize my project using `npm init`.

* As a developer, I want to be able to save packages to my project using `npm install`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I see the `package.json` file created in the [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) folder.

* It's done when I see the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file in the [Unsolved](./Unsolved/) folder.

* It's done when I have installed the `inquirer` package successfully and see it listed in the `package.json` file.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

* [npm-init](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-init)

* [npm-install](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install)

## 💡 Hints

* If we are provided a `package.json` file, what is the only command we would need to run in order to install those packages?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How does the `-y` save us some time when running `npm init`? What does the `-g` flag do when running `npm install`? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 6. Instructor Review: Node Package Manager (npm) (10 min) 

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with npm? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `npm init`

  * ✔️ `npm install`

* Open `18-Stu-Package-npm/Solved/package.json` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 We start by running `npm init -y`, which will generate the `package.json` file. Optionally, we can run the command without the `-y` flag to allow for more custom responses.

  ```sh
  npm init -y
  npm init
  ```

  * Notice this creates the `package.json` file as well as the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.

  * 🔑  In order to install the `inquirer` package, we run `npm install inquirer --save`, or just `npm i inquirer --save`. 

  ```sh
  npm install inquirer --save
  ```

  * If we check our `package.json` file again, we will see `inquirer` listed under `dependencies`.

  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "inquirer": "^7.3.3"
  }
  ```

  * Sometimes, the `package.json` file will be provided for us and we'll just need to install it by running `npm install` in the same directory as the `package.json` file.

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```

  * Running `npm install` is a great first step with any project or exercise that you cloned down from another user or organization.

  * Lastly, sometimes we want to install a package, but not as part of our production app. In this case, we can use `npm install jest --save-dev`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does the `--save` flag do, and is it always necessary?

  * 🙋 The `--save` flag ensures that we add the dependency to the list outlined inside the `package.json`. Newer versions of npm will do this automatically, so it isn't always required.

  * ☝️ How do we install a specific package?

  * 🙋 We can run `npm install <package name>`.
  
  * ☝️ How do we create a `package.json` file and skip the questions?

  * 🙋 We can run `npm init -y`.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 7. Instructor Demo: inquirer (5 min) 

* Run `19-Ins_Inquirer-Demo/index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 We can see a `package.json` that exists already, indicating that we should run the following command:

  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
  
  * 🔑 When we run `node index.js`, unlike previous Node.js applications that we have built, this one is not only outputting text to the terminal but is also asking us for some input, as shown in the following example:

  ```sh
  ? What is your user name?
  ? What is your password?
  ? Re-enter password to confirm:
  ```

  * 🔑 The application asks for a username, a password, and then a confirmation. If the passwords match, the application logs "Success!”

* Open `19-Ins_Inquirer-Demo/index.js` and examine the code:
  
  * At the top of the file, we import `inquirer`, as follows:

  ```js
  var inquirer = require("inquirer");
  ```

  * 🔑  We use the `prompt` method to ask the user for input, as shown in the following example:

  ```js
  inquirer
    .prompt([
    {
      type: "input",
      message: "What is your user name?",
      name: "username"
    },
    {
      type: "password",
      message: "What is your password?",
      name: "password"
    },
    {
      type: "password",
      message: "Re-enter password to confirm:",
      name: "confirm"
    }
    ])
  ```

  * The prompts are an array of objects that have a `name`, `type`, and `message` property.
  
  * The input of each prompt will be stored in an `object` property that corresponds to the `name` value. The `type` values are built into `inquirer` and allow us to enter secure passwords.
  
  * The `message` property is the prompt that the user ends up seeing. 

  * Once all of the prompts are answered, we can then work with the user `response`. Here, the `response` parameter in the `.then` callback corresponds with the user input, which `inquirer` stores in an object, as follows:

  ```js
  .then((response) =>
    response.confirm === response.password
      ? console.log('Success!')
      : console.log('You forgot your password already?!'));
  ```

  * Here we are checking whether the confirmed password input is strictly equal to the password provided in the previous response. We then use a conditional (ternary) operator to check if the passwords match. If so, we log "success!"; otherwise, we let the user know they forgot their password.
 
* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Based on the name alone, what do you think the `inquirer` package allows us to do?

  * 🙋 It might be used to inquire, or ask for, information from someone&mdash;the user of the application. 

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_Inquirer-Users/README.md`.

### 8. Student Do: inquirer Users (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `20-Stu_Inquirer-Users/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Build CLI App with Inquirer

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to create a command-line application that takes in input from the user and does something with it.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have initialized my repository with a `package.json` file by running `npm init -y`.

  * It's done when I have installed inquirer and added it to my list of dependencies by running `npm i inquirer --save`.

  * It's done when the application asks the user, "What is your name?"
    
  * It's done when the application asks the user, "What languages do you know?"

  * It's done when the application asks the user, “What is your preferred method of communication?"

  * It's done after I have written those responses to a file.

  ## 💡 Hints

  Why do we need to use `JSON.stringify`? How can we use the npm page for `inquirer` to see how to use checkboxes and lists? 

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How would you format your JSON? Can you generate the name of your user file from the user input?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 9. Instructor Review: inquirer Users (15 min)

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with `inquirer`? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `inquirer.prompt()`

  * ✔️ `JSON.stringify()`

  * ✔️ `.then(answers => `

* Open `20-Stu_Inquirer-Users/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 The application requires two dependencies, one third-party (`inquirer`) and the other standard library (`fs`), as shown in the following example:

  ```js
  const inquirer = require('inquirer');
  const fs = require('fs');
  ```

  * 🔑 We use two new `type` properties to prompt the user for a `"checkbox"` and a `"list"`, both of which require a `choices` property and a corresponding array of options, as shown in the following example:

  ```js
  inquirer.prompt([
    {
      type: "input",
      name: "name",
      message: "What is your name?"
    },
    {
      type: "checkbox",
      message: "What languages do you know?",
      name: "stack",
      choices: [
        "HTML", 
        "CSS", 
        "JavaScript", 
        "MySQL"
      ]
    },
    {
      type: "list",
      message: "What is your preferred method of communication?",
      name: "contact",
      choices: [
        "email",
        "phone",
        "telekinesis"
      ]
    }
  ])
  ```
  
  * We pass the output of the `prompt` method to the Promise callback as `data`, as follows:

  ```js
  .then((data) => {
    const filename = `${data.name.toLowerCase().split(' ').join('')}.json`;

    fs.writeFile(filename, JSON.stringify(data, null, '\t'), (err) =>
      err ? console.log(err) : console.log('Success!')
    );
  });
  ```

  * We are creating a file name by removing the spaces and setting all letters to lowercase. We then concat the file name using the `.join` method. Finally, we add `.json` to the file name.
  
  * 🔑 We use the `fs.writeFile` method to create a new file using the `filename` variable. We use the `JSON.stringify` optional `replacer` (`null`) and `space` (`\t`) parameters to format the `data` object with pretty-print appearance.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why do we need to use `JSON.stringify` when passing in the data?

  * 🙋 The data needs to be converted to a string because, as is, `data` is not of type `string`. To learn more, read the [MDN Web Docs on JSON.stringify()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify).
  
  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [inquirer documentation](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js#readme), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.
  
* Answer any questions before moving to flex time.

### 10. FLEX (30 min)

### 11. BREAK (30 min)

### 12. Instructor Do: Stoke Curiosity (10 min)

* Welcome students to class and congratulate them on learning some of the most used ES6 syntax rules.

* Reassure students that learning new syntax can be time-consuming and difficult, but it won't always feel like that. Using these rules more will allow you to commit them to memory and use less mental bandwidth going forward.

* Explain that one of the best ways to learn these new rules is to use the newer syntax whenever possible. The old syntax is still perfectly valid, and students can always fall back on it.

* These newer syntax rules are not born in a vacuum. They are the result of years of revision by a standards organization called ECMA. It is important to have standards in web development to ensure maximum compatibility across a wide spectrum of web browsers.

* The ES in ES6 stands for **ECMAScript**. ECMAScript itself is a programming language, but as far as we are concerned, it is just a language from which syntax rules are inherited. We can find a more detailed history in the [Wikipedia article on ECMAScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript).

### 13. Instructor Demo: for...of (5 min) 

* Open `21-Ins_for-of/index.js` in your browser and demonstrate the following:

* Run `node index.js` after commenting out the `.map` example. 

  * 🔑 Notice when we run the code that we see each value in the songs array, as follows:

    ```js
    const songs = ['Bad Guy', 'Old Town Road', '7 Rings'];

    for (const value of songs) {
        console.log(value);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 After we comment in the second example, we use a `for...of` loop to iterate over an object or map, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    const songs = new Map([['Bad Guy', 1], ['Old Town Road', 2]]);

    for (const [key, value] of songs) {
        console.log(`${key}'s chart position is ${value}`);
    }
    ```

  * 🔑 Explain that the `for...of` statement creates a loop iterating over objects, including `Array`, `Map`, `Set`, `String`, `TypedArray`.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How does the `for...of` seem to differ from a `forEach`?

  * 🙋 The `forEach` method only applies to arrays, while the `for...of` is much more flexible.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_for-of/README.md`.

### 14. Student Do: for...of (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `22-Stu_for-of/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement and Use for...of Loops

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to use `for...of` loops to iterate through data inside objects.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have selected all the inside `#songs` elements in the `html`.

  * It's done when I have iterated through the song collection with a `for...of` loop and added a `class` of `red` to each element.

  ## 💡 Hints

  What part of the object is essential in setting up the iteration of a `for...of` loop?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * How could you iterate through deeply nested objects?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 15. Instructor Review: for...of (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with the `for...of` loop? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ `for...of`
  
  * ✔️ Iterator

* Open `22-Stu_for-of/Solved/index.html` in your browser and explain the following: 

    * 🔑 The syntax for the `for...of` loop reads very similar to plain English, which helps conceptualize what is happening in the program.

  * 🔑 The syntax is relatively straightforward. The key takeaway is knowing when to use and what to use it for.

  * When we open the `index.html` file, we notice that each line item in the unordered list has a green color.
  
  * This is the result of using the `for...of` loop to iterate over each line item and add the class of `green` to the class list for the given element, as follows:

    ```js
        const songs = document.querySelectorAll("ul > li");

        for (const song of songs) {
            song.classList.add("green");
        }
    ```

  * 🔑 If you forget the syntax, VS Code can help you create these types of loops by offering a snippet to work from. You can try it yourself by typing `forof` and simply pressing Enter, which will result in the following code:
    
    ```js
        for (const iterator of object) {
            
        }
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How do you know when to use a `for...of` loop?

  * 🙋 While it generally depends on the situation, `for...of` loops help most when you need to iterate through key-value pairs in an object.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on for...of](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 16. Instructor Demo: Rest and Spread Operators (5 min) 

* Open `23-Ins_Rest-and-Spread/index.js` in your browser.

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 When we run the file, we get output for a few different operations: without the rest operator, with the rest operator, without spread, and with spread, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    function add(x, y) {
        return x + y;
    }

    console.log(add(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)) // => 3
    ```

  * Explain to the class that it is possible to call a function with any number of arguments, but only the first two will be counted.
  
  * Let's examine this function using the `rest` operator, as follows:

    ```js
    function add(...nums) {
        let sum = 0;
        for (let num of nums) sum += num;
        return sum
    }

    add(1) // => 1
    add(3,3) // => 6
    add(1, 1, 4, 5) // => 11
    ```

  * In this example, we use a rest operator to collect all of the arguments into a `nums` array, enabling us to pass in as many arguments as we want.

  * Now let's review the following example:

    ```js
    function howManyArgs(...args) {
        return `You passed ${args.length} arguments.`; // point out the template literal
    }

    console.log(howManyArgs(0, 1)); // You have passed 2 arguments.
    console.log(howManyArgs("argument!", null, ["one", 2, "three"], 4)); // You have passed 4 arguments.
    ```

  * 🔑  The takeaway here is that variables are now available inside the array of the function. We can also pass as many in as we want.

  * 🔑  The spread operator allows iterables like arrays, objects, and strings to be expanded into single arguments or elements. 
  
  * You can compare this to pouring items out of a cup. The only difference is that the items are variables and the cup is an iterable.

  * In the following example, we have expanded both arrays into a new array with all of the elements:

    ```js
    // Spread Operator

    let dragons = ['Drogon', 'Viserion', 'Rhaegal'];
    let weapons = ['dragonglass', ...dragons, 'wildfire']; // notice the spread operator ...dragons

    console.log(weapons); // prints ["dragonglass", "Drogon", "Viserion", "Rhaegal", "wildfire"]

    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Why does the first example of the `add()` function only output `3`?

  * 🙋 Because only the first and second parameter get counted without the use of the rest operator.
  
  * ☝️ The syntax for spread and rest are similar, but what is the difference between the two?

  * 🙋 The rest operator allows us to pass in any number of arguments, while the spread operator allows us to spread out an iterable into unique variables.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Rest-and-Spread/README.md`.

### 17. Student Do: Rest and Spread Operators (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `24-Stu_Rest-and-Spread/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement and Use Spread and Rest Operators

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to use the spread and rest operators to make my code easier to read.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have copied the `songs` array using spread `...`.

  * It's done when I have console logged the new array.

  * It's done wheen I have modified the `addition` function so that it retains functionality but also allows one to pass in any number of arguments.

  ## 💡 Hints

  Can you think of some real-life analogies for the spread and rest operator?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * What other data types can you use the spread or rest operator on?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 18. Instructor Review: Spread and Rest Operators (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with spread and rest operators? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Spread syntax (`...`)

  * ✔️ Rest operator

  * ✔️ Multiple arguments

* Open `24-Stu_Rest-and-Spread/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 During this exercise we also used something called `reduce`, which is used in this case to calculate the sum of an array. Let's look at the [MDN Web Docs on reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce) briefly before we review.

  * In the first example, we are using the spread operator to copy the items in `songs` to `new_songs`. Much like we would be dumping out the contents of a cup, we are populating the `new_songs` array with the items in `songs`, as shown in the following code:

    ```js
    const songs = ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
    const new_songs = [...songs];

    console.log(new_songs); // => ["Creep", "Everlong", "Bulls On Parade", "Song 2", "What I Got"];
    ```

* Next we modify the addition function to make use of the rest operator. This allows us to pass in as many arguments as we need. This is particularly useful in this case where we want to add as many numbers as necessary. The code should resemble the following example:

    ```js
    // unsolved version
    function addition(x, y, z) {
        const array = [x, y, z];
        return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    }
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6

    // solved using rest
    function addition(...array) {
        return array.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0); // you don't have to change this line of code but look up reduce if you're not sure what it does here https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce
    }
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3)); // 6
    console.log(addition(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)); // 110
    ```

  * 🔑  There is a good chance that students might be confused on where spread and operators go, because they are very similar and can be used in similar situations. This is just an introduction; assure students that they will begin to pick up fluency as they get more practice.

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ What does the reduce method help us with in this exercise?

  * 🙋 The reduce method reduces an array to a single value. It takes a callback function and runs that function for each value in the array starting from the left to the right.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋 We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) and the [MDN Web Docs on rest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

### 19. Instructor Demo: Object Destructuring (5 min) 

* Open `25-Ins_Obj-Destructuring/index.js` in your browser.

* Run `node index.js` from the command line and demonstrate the following: 

  * 🔑 Notice that when we run the `index.js` file we see several variables logged to the terminal. Each of these are different ways of accessing variables inside an object.

  * 🔑 Also, in the file, we are using dot notation to access variables inside an object, as we have in the past. We are plucking off certain variables and setting them equal to the value of the object. This is done with curly braces on the left side of the equals sign, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const arya = {
      name: 'Arya Stark',
      parents: ['Eddard Stark', 'Catelyn Stark'],
    };

    const { name, parents } = arya;
    ```

  * You can now also use object destructuring as a way to pluck off certain variables from an object. Consider the following example:

    ```js
    const betterLogCharacter = ({ name, parents }) =>
    console.log(`${name}'s parents are: ${parents[0]} and ${parents[1]}.`);

    betterLogCharacter(jaime);
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How would we build this?

  * 🙋 We could look up examples of object destructuring and get a feel for the logic before attempting the activity.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Obj-Destructuring/README.md`.

### 20. Student Do: Object Destructuring (15 min) 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `26-Stu_Obj-Destructuring/README.md`.

* Break your students into pairs that will work together on this activity.

  ```md
  # 🏗️ Implement and Recognize Object Destructuring

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to know how to use destructuring assignment syntax to pluck out data from arrays or objects.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when I have opened `index.js` and reviewed the existing code.

  * It's done when I have used destructuring assignment syntax so that each `console.log` statement logs out the value properly.

  ## 💡 Hints

  You have likely seen destructuring more than you think in your everyday life as a developer. Is there an import statement that you can remember from a previous exercise that uses this syntax?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Write an object of your own and then log each key-value pair using object destructuring.

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
  ```

* While breaking everyone into groups, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

### 21. Instructor Review: Object Destructuring (10 min)  

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ How comfortable do you feel with object destructuring? (Poll via Fist to Five, Slack, or Zoom)

* Assure students that we will cover the solution to help solidify their understanding. If questions remain, remind them to use office hours to get extra help!

* Use the prompts and talking points (🔑) below to review the following key points:

  * ✔️ Object destructuring syntax

  * ✔️ Destructuring nested objects

* Open `26-Stu_Obj-Destructuring/Solved/index.js` in your IDE and explain the following: 

  * 🔑 This exercise highlights how we can pluck off multiple properties at once, saving us a few lines of code.

  * 🔑 We can also destructure function parameters. This allows us to name them directly and again save a few steps.  

  * 🔑 Now we can simply expect an object and pull the properties off without worrying about the order they're passed in or writing extra code to destructure them the old way.

  * In the past, if we wanted to cherry-pick an object's properties, we'd have to do something like the following example:

    ```js
    const arya = {
      name: "Arya Stark",
      parents: ["Eddard Stark", "Catelyn Stark"]
    };

    const aryaName = arya.name; // "Arya Stark"
    const aryaParents = arya.parents; // ["Eddard Stark", "Catelyn Stark"]`
    ```

  * 🔑  With ES6 object destructuring syntax, the code will now resemble the following example:

    ```js
    const { name, parents } = arya;

    console.log(name); // prints `"Jaime Lannister"`
    console.log(parents); // prints `["Tywin Lannister", "Joanna Lannister"]`
    ```

  * We can also rename the destructured properties as follows:

    ```js
    const jaime = {
      name: "Jaime Lannister",
      parents: ["Tywin Lannister", "Joanna Lannister"]
    };

    const { name: jaimeName } = jaime;
    console.log(jaimeName); // prints `"Jaime Lannister"`
    ```

  * We can also handle nested objects in a much more elegant way, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
      const jon = {
      first: "Jon",
      last: "Snow",
      title: "Prince",
      family: {
        brothers: {
          brother1: "Rob Stark",
          brother2: "Rickon Stark"
        },
        sisters: {
          sister1: "Arya Stark",
          sister2: "Sansa Stark"
        }
      }
    };

    const { brother1, brother2 } = jon.family.brothers;
    console.log(brother1); // <= Rob Stark
    console.log(brother2); // <= Rickon Stark
    ```

  * 🔑  This also works with arrays, as shown in the following example:

    ```js
    const characters = ["Ned Stark", "The Quiet Wolf", "House Stark"];

    const [name, alias, allegiance] = characters;
    console.log(name, alias, allegiance); // <= Ned Stark The Quiet Wolf House Stark
    ```

  * You can also use destructuring with strings, like in the following code:

    ```js
    const skills = "The Usurper, Baratheon, Cersei"; // string of data

    const [alias, family, spouse] = skills.split(","); // set variables and split
    console.log(alias, family, spouse); // print them by variable name
    ```

* Ask the class the following questions (☝️) and call on students for the answers (🙋):

  * ☝️ Does the order matter when passing destructured object properties into a function? 

  * 🙋 No! Because we are referring to the properties in the object by name, the key names will align with the correct value every time.

  * ☝️ What can we do if we don't completely understand this?

  * 🙋  We can refer to supplemental material, read the [MDN Web Docs on object destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment), and stick around for office hours to ask for help.

* Answer any questions before proceeding to the next activity.

* In preparation for the activity, ask TAs to start directing students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Fork/README.md`.

### 22. Everyone Do: Git Fork (20 min)

*  Open [Git docs](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) in your browser and explain the following:

  * Forking allows you to contribute to a repository that you don't have push access to. When you fork a project, GitHub will make an exact copy of the project that will live on your account that you can push to.
  
  * This workflow then allows you to create a pull request to the parent repository when you have finished your contributions. This is a very common workflow in many open source projects. 

* Direct students to the activity instructions found in `27-Evr_Git-Fork/README.md`.

* While everyone is working on the activity, be sure to remind students and the rest of the instructional staff that questions on Slack or otherwise are welcome and will be handled. It's a good way for your team to prioritize students that need extra help.

* Open your browser and choose a repository to fork. Click the green fork button. 

* Open your command line and demonstrate the following:

  * After we clone the repository, we will want to visit our own fork and copy the Git URL to clone it the local machine, as follows:

    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:microsoft/vscode.git
    ```

  * 🔑 After you clone the local repository, run the following command to demonstrate that the remote is pointed to your namespace rather than the parent repository:

    ```sh
    git remote -v
    ```

* Answer any questions before ending class for the day
