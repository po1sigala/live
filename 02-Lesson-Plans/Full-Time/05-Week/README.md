# Week 05 Instructor Overview: Node.js and OOP

## Overview

In the first half of this week, you'll introduce students to Node.js and the concepts of standard libraries, modules, npm, and `package.json` files. In the second half of this week, you'll introduce students to JavaScript constructors, classes and the concept of TDD.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit 09 Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/README.md) and the [Class Content Unit 10 Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* The transition from client-side development to Node.js can be challenging for students. This lesson plan is a gentle introduction to the fundamentals.

* If students question why they are learning Node.js, emphasize its role in the client-server model. Full-stack developers must be able to build applications using the client-server model, and they will likely face interview questions about the difference between the client and the server and how they relate to each other.

* Ensure that students have already installed Node.js on their computers before coming to class.

  * Direct students to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* We will also spend a day this week practicing TDD. Since students have limited exposure to testing, emphasize the importance and benefits of testing. Remind students that just like with other libraries syntax will fall into place over time.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connections folder](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

Next unit, we will be diving into servers and Express. Spend as much time as you can making sure that students understand Node.js fundamentals. 

In the next unit, students will start using Heroku to host their web applications. Be sure to send out the [instructions for installing the Heroku CLI](../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/04-Important/heroku-install.md) and remind students to sign up for a Heroku account before starting the next unit.
