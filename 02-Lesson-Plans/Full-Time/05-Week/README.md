# Week 05: Introduction to Node and NPM

## Overview

In this unit, we will be introducing students to application building with Node and the use of external NPM packages.

## Heads Up

* In this unit, students are learning about Node.js. Be sure students have already installed Node.js on their [Mac](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-mac.md) or [Windows](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-win.md) computers.

* In the next unit, students will start using Heroku to host their web applications. Be sure to send out the [instructions for installing the Heroku CLI](../../../01-Class-Content/10-OOP/04-Important/heroku-install.md) and remind students to sign up for a Heroku account before starting the next unit. 

* In the next unit, students will also start using MySQL. Be sure to send out the instructions for installing both the MySQL Server and Workbench on [Mac](../../../01-Class-Content/11-express/04-Important/mysql-mac-guide.md) and [Windows](../../../01-Class-Content/11-express/04-Important/mysql-windows-guide.md) computers by the end of this unit to minimize install time next unit.
