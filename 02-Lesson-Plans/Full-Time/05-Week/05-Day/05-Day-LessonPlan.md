## Day 5 - The Power of Packages (10:00 AM)


## Overview

In this class, students will learn the benefits of OOP and learn how to apply many OOP practices to their JavaScript applications using ES6 classes.

## Instructor Notes

* `Summary: Complete activities 17-24 in 10-OOP`

* The primary focus of the class should be introducing students to OOP concepts. Let the students know that it's okay if the new syntax feels overwhelming. The purpose of this lesson is to help students get comfortable with working with code that's organized with OOP practices.

* Today's lesson will rely heavily on ES6 classes. It is recommended that you spend some time getting familiar with classes, subclasses, and the `super()` method before class starts.

## Learning Objectives

* Implement ES6 class syntax to instantiate multiple instances of a single type of object.

* Construct subclasses that inherit features from a common ancestor class.

* Demonstrate "thinking in OOP" by using objects to control the flow of action in an application.
