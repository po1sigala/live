# XX.X Full-Time Lesson Plan: Node.js, ES6 (Note: Full-Time Monday LP using PT odd unit's .1/.2 LPs)

## Overview 

This lesson introduces Node.js and the new syntax that comes with ES6. This includes arrow functions also new variables `let` and `const`. Finally we will cover template literals and how they can be helpful in our development process.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Node-Demo` through `10-Stu_TemplateLiterals`

* Students will be expected to have Node installed, but if they don't, be sure to empower them to know that they can install it using the resources found in `04-Important`. Installation steps are available for [Mac](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-mac.md) and [Windows](../../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Important/nodejs-install-win.md).

    * A helpful link to direct students to is https://nodejs.org/en/
    * Remind students that they will want the LTS (long term support) version.
    * `node -v` in the terminal will output a version number if installed correctly.

* Transitioning from client-side to backend development can be a little confusing at first. This is a good opportunity to remind students that Node is Chrome's V8 engine running on your machine rather than in the browser. This gives us the ability to have access to things like the filesystem.

* Students may ask why they are learning Node.JS. This is a great opportunity to explain that this allows to create our own APIs and build our own applications using the client-server model.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code. 

* If you are comfortable doing so, live code the solutions to the activities. If not, no worries. Use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review. 

* Let students know that the Bonus for each activity is meant to give them "food for thought". Rather than extra coding practice, it is a self-study on related topics that are beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to dig deeper and further their knowledge on this topic.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of class, students will be able to:

* Explain the client-server model
* Run simple very simple javascript files from the command line using Node
* Understand arrow functions and how they impact the `this` context
* Use template strings, also how to use `const` and `let` in place of `var`
* Use functional loops like `.map` and `.filter`
