## Overview

This lesson introduces Node.js and the concepts of standard library, modules, npm, and package.json. Students will build an interactive command line application that outputs .json files using `fs` and `Inquirer`.

## Instructor Notes

* Complete activities `01-Ins_Node-Demo` through `15-Stu_Inquirer-Users`

* Ensure that students have [downloaded and installed the LTS version of Node](https://nodejs.org/en/). The version number does not matter, just that it is the LTS version.

* The transition from client-side development to Node.js can be challenging for students. This lesson plan is a gentle introduction to the fundamentals.

* If students continually question why they are learning Node.js, emphasize the client-server model.


## Learning Objectives

* Explain the client-server model

* Run Node.js applications from the command line with arguments

* Import standard library packages

* Initialize projects and install third-party packages using npm

* Build interactive CLI applications with Inquirer
