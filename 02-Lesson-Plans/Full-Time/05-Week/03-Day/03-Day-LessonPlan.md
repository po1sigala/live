## Overview

In this class we will be introducing students to the usage of JavaScript constructors and how they can be used to dynamically create objects with similar schemas.

## Instructor's Notes

@TODO
* `Summary: Complete activities 1-7 in Unit 10`

* Constructors are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types and allow for the development of very interesting applications. Make sure your students have a firm understanding of how objects function.

## Learning Objectives

* By the end of class students will be able to...

  * Use OOP to create a banking application.

  * Use constructor functions to create new objects.

  * Use object prototypes to add methods to objects.
