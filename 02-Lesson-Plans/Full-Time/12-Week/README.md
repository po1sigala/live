# Unit 23 & 24 Instructor Overview: Project 3

## Overview

In Unit 23, students will begin work on their final projects. These projects are student-driven; they will be responsible for forming their own teams, brainstorming app ideas, and developing a full-stack MERN app. The final project of the Boot Camp will be a full-stack MERN application.

In Unit 24, students will continue to work on their final project and present their final projects to the class at the end of the unit. They'll also finish up their professional materials, including their portfolios, and add their final projects once they've completed them.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview for Unit 23](../../../01-Class-Content/23-Project-3/README.md) and  [Class Content Unit Overview for Unit 24](../../../01-Class-Content/24-Project-3-Contd/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* For the final project, students will be choosing their own groups. Let students know that they should contact the instructor or TAs when they have decided on their groups for approval. Please be flexible and empathetic in addressing student concerns regarding groups, or the lack of members to team up with.

* Students can also use this time to work on their portfolios and any unfinished career homework assignments.

* Encourage students to spend time pseudocoding their projects and researching APIs and libraries before writing any code.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.
