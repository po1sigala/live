# 11.2 Full-Time Lesson Plan: 

## Overview

This class focuses on using Apollo's client-side library to consume a GraphQL API. React Router and JSON Web Tokens to add authentication to a MERN-stack application is also covered.

## Instructor Notes

* In this lesson, students will complete activities `15-Ins_useMutation` through `27-Evr_GitHub-Actions`.

* The `17-Ins_Apollo-Cache` uses Apollo Client Developer Tools to visualize the in-memory cache. If you have not yet done it, install the [Apollo Client Developer Tools extension for Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm?hl=en-US). Once installed, open Chrome DevTools and navigate to the `>>` arrow on the toolbar to see additional tools available. Click on `Apollo` to open the interface.

* If you get an `eslint` preflight check error when running the Homework demo, add an `.env` folder to the root of the project and add `SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true`. The error can also be avoided by running the homework demo from the class repo to avoid conflicting `eslint` installations.

* It is highly recommended that prior to class, you go through each demo and activity so that you are familiar with the code and can anticipate issues that students new to the MERN framework and React.js may face.

* Remind students to do a `git pull` of the class repo and to have today's activities ready and open in VS Code.

* If you are comfortable doing so, live-code the solutions to the activities. If not, just use the solutions provided and follow the prompts and talking points for review.

* Let students know that the Bonus at the end of each activity is not meant to be extra coding practice, but instead is a self-study on topics beyond the scope of this unit for those who want to further their knowledge.

## Learning Objectives

* Use `useMutation` Apollo Hook to fetch and update data.

* Explain what the Apollo Cache is and identify when it needs updating.

* Use React Router to tie a component to a URL route.

 * Create and verify a JSON Web Token to log in the user.

* Store, check expiration of, and pass JSON Web Tokens to an Apollo Client.

* Implement server-side authentication in GraphQL API.

* Explain a practical use case for implementing GitHub Actions.
