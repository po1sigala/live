# Unit 15 & 16 Instructor Overview: Project 2

## Overview

In Unit 15, students will begin work on their second project of the Boot Camp--a full-stack application which connects a robust back-end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication to an intuitive front end.

In Unit 16, students will continue to work on their second project and present their projects to the class at the end of the unit. They'll also begin to revise their professional materials, including their portfolios, and add their projects once they've completed them.

Refer to the Class Content Unit Overview for [Unit 15](../../../01-Class-Content/15-Project-2/README.md) and [Unit 16](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/README.md)for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Prepare a list of project group members prior to the first class of Unit 15. This time, assign three students per group, all around the same skill level. You can add a slide to this unit's slide deck to list the group members, or you can send the list out to students via Slack. Let students know that they will be allowed to create their own groups for the final project.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* Encourage students to spend time pseudocoding their projects and researching APIs and libraries before writing any code. Remind them that they already have code they can reuse for authentication from the previous unit.

* Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in their Career Connection folder for [Unit 16](../../../01-Class-Content/16-Project-2-Contd/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

In Unit 17, you'll be taking a look at how computer science relates to what students have learned so far with JavaScript. We recommend that you take a moment to review topics that pertain to data structures, the JavaScript event loop, and closures. Keep in mind that these topics can be hard for students to grasp, but it's important to learn because it will help students prepare for the technical interview phase of any software job.

Before Unit 18, make sure you install MongoDB and Robo 3T on your machine. Encourage the students to install it prior to class using the [MongoDB installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb) and the [Robo 3T download page](https://robomongo.org/download).

If you haven't used MongoDB and Robo 3T much in the past, take a look at next week's queries and solutions.
