## Overview

In this unit, we will continue to work on project 2, with presentations on the final day.

Refer to the following links for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework:

## Instructor / TA Notes

Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before project day presentations.

In Unit 18, students have the option to complete the Java asynchronous unit. Make sure you add this to the class repo now, and let students know where to find it. Note that the Java unit is completely optional.

## Heads Up

Alert instructional staff to expectations for the next unit, i.e: installations, challenging topics, preparation for projects, etc.

## Helpful Links


Before next unit, make sure you install MongoDB and Robo 3T on your machine--you'll need both.

If you haven't used MongoDB much in the past, take a look at next week's queries and solutions. This should prime you for the lecture.
