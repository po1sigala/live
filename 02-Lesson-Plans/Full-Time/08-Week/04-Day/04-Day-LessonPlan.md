## Class Instruction

### 1. Students Do: Project Work (150 mins)

* Let students know this is the last full day they will have to work on their projects in class and will be presenting tomorrow.

* Continue working on project 2!

### 2. Everyone Do: BREAK (30 mins)

### 3. Everyone Do: Outline Presentation (30 mins)

* Announce that students have the next half-hour to outline their presentations.

  * Make sure they don't code. They should consider:

  * The structure of their presentation;
  * The key messages they need to show; and
  * The details that they should _avoid_ reviewing (they only have 10 minutes to talk).

* Offer these tidbits of advice:

  * The presentation of any project to an audience must flow like a story. Your narrative should open on a conflict, hint at a potential resolution for that problem, depict the steps taken to resolve the issue, and finally end on the resolution of the conflict with an eye toward the future. In other words:
    1. What problem does your app focus on.
    2. How does your app solve this problem at a high-level.
    3. What steps did you take to build the app.
    4. Show the app running and solving the problem that began your story. Also talk about what features you'd like to add in an update to your app.

* While the groups organize their presentations, offer to answer any questions about Saturday. 

* About 10 minutes in, you should walk around and make sure that students aren't coding. If it looks like they are, just walk up and warmly ask how they're progressing so far with their outline. 

  * Don't accuse them of not following directions; just steer them on course.

### 4. Students Do: Project Work (60 mins)

* Continue working on project 2!

* Remind your class that they will be presenting after break tomorrow. (Around 12:30 PM)

### 5. END (0 mins)
