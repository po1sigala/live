# Unit 07 & 08 Instructor Overview: Project 1

## Overview

In Unit 07, you will introduce agile project management and help students with their first project, an API-powered interactive front-end web application that pulls data from multiple sources in a creative way. Students will learn how to write user stories and acceptance criteria. Students will create a new repository for their project and learn how to use GitHub Issues and GitHub Projects to keep track of their project progress. You will assume the role of "scrummaster" and hold daily scrum meetings with each group.

In Unit 08, students will continue to work on their projects and will present them to the class at the end of the unit. They'll also update their professional materials, including their portfolio, GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile.

Refer to the Class Content Unit Overview for [Unit 07](../../../01-Class-Content/07-Project-1/README.md) and [Unit 08](../../../01-Class-Content/08-Project-1-Contd/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* Prepare a list of project group members prior to the first class of Unit 07. Assign three students per group: one advanced, one average, one struggling. You can add a slide to the Unit 07 slide deck to list the group members, or you can send the list out to students via Slack. Let students know that they will be allowed to create their own groups for the final project.

* If students complain about group configurations, remind them of the following:

  * In the real-world, you don't get to choose your co-workers.

  * Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* The Instructor Demo activities on the first day of Unit 07 ask you to create a project repository. You can create one on-the-fly or you may want to create on in advance.

* Be sure to spend plenty of time making sure that students can follow best practices while collaborating with git.

* Students can use the [API Resources Blog Post](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources) for ideas on free APIs that don't require CORS to use in their projects.

* Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Students must have a deployed project by presentation day, so encourage students to work on deploying their projects by the class prior to presentation day at the latest. Since you can always update deployed projects, it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

## Career Connection

* There is no career services material for Unit 07.

* Remind students that related career services material can be found in their Career Connection folder for [Unit 08](../../../01-Class-Content/08-Project-1-Contd/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on career services, visit the [career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/?utm_medium=Academics&utm_source=boot_camp/).

## Heads-Up

* Before starting Unit 09, make sure you install Node.js on your machine. Refer to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

* Also, remind students have it installed prior to coming to class!

* In Unit 10, we begin Object-Oriented Programming, constructors, and classes. With that in mind, it's important to get students comfortable with ES6 and other Node.js fundamentals to prepare them for more abstract concepts.
