# Unit 04: Project 1

## Overview

In this unit, students will begin work on their first Project of the Boot Camp, an API-powered web application that pulls data from multiple sources in a creative way.

* Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/07-Project-1/README.md) for detailed information on key topics and learning objectives.

## Instructor / TA Notes

* Some students may complain about group configurations. Be sure to remind them of the following:

  * In the real-world, you don't get to choose your co-workers.

  * Working collaboratively is an important skill to acquire as a developer.

* Make sure to spend plenty of time making sure that students can follow best practices while collaborating with git.

* Project presentations are on the last day of this unit. Remember, students must have deployed projects by presentation day, so encourage students to work on deploying their projects by Day 4 at the latest. Since you can always update deployed projects, it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.

  * Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_u8TKy5zW5UlrVQVnyDEZ0unGI2tjQPDEpA0FNuBKAw/edit?usp=sharing) with students to prepare for their presentations on Day 4. Inform students that they will have 10 minutes to present and must be prepared to answer questions.

  * Prior to the last class, prepare a list of questions to ask each group to encourage discussion.

  * Also collaborate with your TAs to prepare a slide deck of superlative "awards" for groups. Refer to [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Heads Up

* In the next unit, students will start using Node.js. Be sure to direct students to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs) before starting the next unit!

## Career Connection
Each week students receive Career Connections in the `04-Important` folders that ties what we do in the classroom to the profession, along with technical interviewing practice.
