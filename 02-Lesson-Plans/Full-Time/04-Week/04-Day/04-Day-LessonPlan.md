# 04.4 Full-Time Lesson Plan: Project 1 

## Overview

Students work in groups on their first project.

## Instructor Notes

* No classroom instruction today. 

* You will assume the role of 'scrum master' and hold standing meetings with each group. The purpose of these scrums is to:

  1. Gauge progress on projects
  
  2. Course correct if scope creeps or focus shifts
  
  3. Most importantly, hold students accountable. Participation is a requirement for receipt of a passing grade.

* To keep the standing meetings short, require that students physically stand up. Ask each student the following questions:

  * What did you accomplish?

  * What are your goals?

  * Are there any obstacles?

* Prioritize working with groups that may be at risk of failure, i.e: unable to deploy a functional application. 

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_u8TKy5zW5UlrVQVnyDEZ0unGI2tjQPDEpA0FNuBKAw/edit?usp=sharing) with students to prepare for their presentations in the next session. Inform students that they will have 10 minutes to present and must be prepared to answer questions.

* In the next unit, students will start using Node.js. Advise the students to have Node.js installed before the next unit. 

## Learning Objectives

* Design, execute and deploy a collaborative project.
