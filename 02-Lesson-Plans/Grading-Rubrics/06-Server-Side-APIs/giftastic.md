### Statement of completion

Be subjective, grading & feedback should not take more than 5 minutes per assignment.

**Repository Naming**

* It will be enticing and easy for students to name their homework something like Unit X Homework, Week X Homework, or Homework X. This has been discouraged in their homework instructions and any repositories without a more unique name should receive an `I` until the name is changed.

**README.md**

* This will be the first week where the students README will become a factor in their grade given. An `A` README would contain the following:
  * Deployed Link
  * Technologies used and *WHY*
  * Specifics about any special functionality
  * Screenshots if necessary
  * Struggles faced and how they were overcome

* If the students README does not contain all of these things, or is just blank/nonexistent give them an `I` until fixed.

**Criteria**

Student utilized jQuery & Giphy API to show the user Giphy results based on their search term. The deployed assignment has been added to their deployed portfolio with a link provided in the submission.

**Is the above statement correct?**

1. **Yes**: Grade will be an A or a B

2. **No**: Grade will be a C

3. **No idea, can't test**: Grade will be a D or an  F

4. **Empty Repository**: Grade will be an I

### Yes (A or B)

If the student's assignment was pristine, give them an A, and an encouraging sentence for feedback.

If the student's assignment had a few areas for improvement, give them a B, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback.

### No (C)

Give the student a C, and 2 or 3 specific pieces of feedback. Invite the student to office hours to go over topics not mastered.

### No idea (D or F)

If the project isn't deployed, the student receives a D.

If the student submitted a homework but nothing works or functions, the student receives an F.

Either way, explain to the student why they received that grade and invite them to visit office hours for help.

### Empty Repository (I)

Students should receive this grade **only** if they submit an empty repository. If the student attempted the homework assignment and was simply unable to get it fully functioning, they should still receive a normal letter grade, not an 'Incomplete'.

**Good Luck!**
