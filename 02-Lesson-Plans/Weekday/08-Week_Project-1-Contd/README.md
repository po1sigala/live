# Unit 08 Instructor Overview: Project 1

## Overview

In this unit, students will continue to work on their projects and will present them to the class at the end of the unit. They'll also update their professional materials, including their portfolio, GitHub profile, resume, and LinkedIn profile.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/08-Project-1-Contd/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Encourage students to spend time deciding how they want to present their project before presentation day.

* Share the [Project Presentation Template](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QaO9KH8HtUXj__81ve0SZcpO5DbMbqqQr4iPpbwKks/edit?usp=sharing) with students early in the week to give them ample time to prepare for their presentations.

* Students must have a deployed project by presentation day, so encourage students to work on deploying their projects by the class prior to presentation day at the latest. Since you can always update deployed projects, it is recommended that students deploy early on and update their live version with every new feature.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Tca5VT_S13ioFUO-pewh_g9dJaBQ9prg-vsRwMjyDXU/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career services material can be found in their [Career Connection Folder](../../../01-Class-Content/08-Project-1-Contd/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career services, visit the [Career services resources page](https://careernetwork.2u.com/).
