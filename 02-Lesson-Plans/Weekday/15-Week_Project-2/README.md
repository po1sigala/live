# Unit 15 Instructor Overview: Project 2

## Overview

In this unit, students will begin work on their second project of the Boot Camp--a full-stack application which connects a robust back-end with servers, databases, advanced APIs, and user authentication to an intuitive front end.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/15-Project-2/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* Prepare a list of project group members prior to the first class for this unit. This time, assign three students per group, all around the same skill level. You can add a slide to this unit's slide deck to list the group members, or you can send the list out to students via Slack. Let students know that they will be allowed to create their own groups for the final project.

* There are occasional circumstances, such as an illness or a personal emergency, which might force a student to complete a group project on their own. In these circumstances, as the instructor, you will meet with the student and SSM to determine if completing the project independently is the best path forward. If it is, you will share adjusted project requirements and a grading rubric with the student.

* Encourage students to spend time pseudocoding their projects and researching APIs and libraries before writing any code. Remind them that they already have code they can reuse for authentication from the previous unit.

## Heads-Up

* Students will present their projects at the end of the next unit. Emphasize that students should focus on deploying a lean MVP, and then add features with any time they have left.

* Prepare a slide deck of superlative awards to give to each group next week. Use [this example](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QlPJhHnHvLLtKheKl4opm7tibkjjALZeAzwVvZdJDO0/edit?usp=sharing), and feel free to customize it as you see fit for your cohort.
