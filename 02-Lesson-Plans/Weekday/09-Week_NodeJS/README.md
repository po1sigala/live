# Unit 09 Instructor Overview: Node.js

## Overview

In this unit, you'll introduce students to Node.js and the concepts of standard libraries, modules, npm, and `package.json` files.

Refer to the [Class Content Unit Overview](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/README.md) for detailed information on key topics, learning objectives, and homework.

## Instructor/TA Notes

* The transition from client-side development to Node.js can be challenging for students. This lesson plan is a gentle introduction to the fundamentals.

* If students question why they are learning Node.js, emphasize its role in the client-server model. Full-stack developers must be able to build applications using the client-server model, and they will likely face interview questions about the difference between the client and the server and how they relate to each other.

* Ensure that students have already installed Node.js on their computers before coming to class.

  * Direct students to the [Node.js installation guide on The Full-Stack Blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/nodejs/how-to-install-nodejs).

## Career Connection

* Remind students that related Career Services material can be found in their [Career Connections folder](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

* If you'd like more information on Career Services, visit the [Career Services resources page](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

Next week, we begin OOP, constructors, and classes. With that in mind, it's important to get students comfortable with ES6 and other Node.js fundamentals this week to prepare them for more abstract concepts.
