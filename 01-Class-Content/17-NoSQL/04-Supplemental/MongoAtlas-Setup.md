# Set Up with Mongo Atlas

* In this guide, we will walk through the steps required to create your account with MongoDB Atlas.

## What is MongoDB Atlas

MongoDB Atlas is a cloud-based database service created and maintained by MongoDB. It works with hosting services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud to help users provision, maintain, and secure new databases for their applications.

We'll use its free service tier to host our MongoDB databases for our production-ready apps when we deploy them. Learn more about it at the [MongoDB Atlas site.](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
