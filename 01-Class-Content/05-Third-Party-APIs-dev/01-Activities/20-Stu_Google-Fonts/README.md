# Google Fonts

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use Google Fonts documentation to customize a web page further with Google Fonts.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) and [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a guestbook that uses basic fonts.

  * Find a font or two (or variations of the same font) from Google Fonts to apply to the guestbook.

  * Once the fonts are selected, remember to apply the Google Fonts `<link>` element to `index.html`.
  
  * In [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css), apply the selected fonts to both the `<body>` element and all heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`). There should be no need to add class styles in this activity!

* Remember, this is an open-ended activity! Work with your partner to find interesting fonts of your choosing. There is no right or wrong answer to this activity.

## üí° Hint(s)

* There are web sites that help pick fonts if you are overwhelmed by the options. Check out [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts) and [FontPair](https://fontpair.co/) for inspiration!

* Don't forget to use typographic CSS properties to adjust font weights and italics if you need to!

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge:

  * How does Google develop their typography? 
  
* You can read [Google‚Äôs Design blog](https://design.google/library/google-fonts/) to learn more.
