# 📖 Add Custom Font to Page with Google Fonts

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to view a customized and well-designed page that uses custom colors and fonts.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the page's body text uses fonts loaded from Google Fonts and not the default Bootstrap fonts.

* It's done when the page's headings text uses fonts loaded from Google Fonts and not the default Bootstrap fonts. 

## 📝 Note(s)

Refer to the documentation: 

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Remember, this is an open-ended activity! Work with your partner to find interesting fonts of your choosing. There is no right or wrong answer to this activity.

* There are web sites that help pick fonts if you are overwhelmed by the options. Check out [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts) and [FontPair](https://fontpair.co/) for inspiration!

* Don't forget to use typographic CSS properties to adjust font weights and italics if you need to!

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge:

  * How does Google develop their typography? 
  
* You can read [Google’s Design blog](https://design.google/library/google-fonts/) to learn more.
