# Google Fonts

In this activity you will work with a partner to take a page and customize it further with Google Fonts.

## Instructions

* Use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to find a font or two (or variations of the same font) to apply to the page in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/index.html).

* Once fonts are selected, apply the Google Fonts `<link>` element to `index.html`

* In `style.css`, apply the selected fonts to both the `<body>` element and all heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`). There should be no need to add class styles in this activity.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * Learn more about typography through [Google‚Äôs Design blog.](https://design.google/library/google-fonts/)

* Check the [Solution](./Solved/index.html) after class and compare it against your own file.

## üí° Hint(s)

* There are web sites that help pick fonts if you are overwhelmed by the options. Check out [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts) and [FontPair](https://fontpair.co/) for inspiration!

* Don't forget to use typographic CSS properties to adjust font weights and italics if you need to!
