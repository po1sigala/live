# Bootstrap Utility Classes

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use the Bootstrap documentation on utilities to take a Bootstrap form component and center it on the page to make it more visually appealing using utility classes.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [Bootstrap documentation for utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a form without any layout formatting.

  * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to apply utility classes to the form in order to center it on the page.

* The result should look like this image:

  * Using Chrome DevTools, what can you do to make this look more personalized? 
  
* Try updating some of the more generic styles to use different colors or font sizes.
