# Bootstrap Utility Classes

In this activity you will work with a partner and use the Bootstrap documentation to take a Bootstrap form component and center it on the page to make it more visually appealing using utility classes.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Use the [Bootstrap documentation for utilities](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) to add to the existing code in [Unsolved file](./Unsolved/index.html) so the result matches this image:

* Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code. Read the comments carefully, as they will provide hints as to where you'll find your answer in the Bootstrap documentation.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * Make this application look more personalized! Open Chrome DevTools and update some of the more generic styles to use different colors or font sizes.

* Check the [Solution](./Solved/index.html) after class and compare it against your own file.

## üí° Hint(s)

* Don't forget to use the previous examples and activities as a guide to how the classes can be used!
