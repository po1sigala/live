# 📖 Enhance UI with jQuery UI Widgets

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

* As a user, I want to easily choose a skill from a list to use in the form.

* As a user, I want to easily select a date from a datepicker instead of writing it out manually.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the form input for entering a skill has an autocomplete feature added to it to pick from a list of skills.

* It's done when the form input for entering a date has a datepicker feature added to it to select by month and year.

## 📝 Note(s)

Refer to the documentation: 

[jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/)

## 💡 Hint(s)

* You will need to add an array of skills to use with the `Autocomplete` widget. For example, `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `Bootstrap`, `React`, and `CSS`. 

* Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples on the `Datepicker` widget page of the jQuery UI docs.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge: 

  * What build-in HTML feature can also help enforce a date? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
