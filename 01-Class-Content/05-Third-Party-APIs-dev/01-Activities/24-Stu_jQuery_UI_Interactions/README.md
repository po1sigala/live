# jQuery UI Interactions

* In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery UI documentation to apply a jQuery UI interaction to the "List of Skills" so that a user can reorder the list items.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/).

* Using the documentation, implement the following jQuery UI interaction:

  * Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and add the jQuery UI interaction that will allow the user to drag and reorder the skills listed under "List of Skills".

  * Add the option to style that white space in between the items shifting to be visible. 

## üí° Hint(s)

* Think about which interaction will allow a user to drag an element to a new spot on the list.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge: 

  * How exactly does this "HTML Drag and Drop" work?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to dig deeper into how this works.
