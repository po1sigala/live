# jQuery Elements

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery documentation to create HTML elements dynamically using jQuery.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to [jQuery API Docs](https://api.jquery.com/) in your browser.

* Open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and examine the comments.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a blank web page.

  * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to create the various elements needed to append a quote by Carol Dweck to the page.

* The result should look like this image:

## üí° Hint(s) 

* Don‚Äôt forget to add jQuery to `index.html` before you begin.

* Only use jQuery methods! Do **NOT** use any of the following vanilla JavaScript methods: `createElement`, `textContent`, or `appendChild`.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:
  
  * How can we add event listeners using jQuery?
  
* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
