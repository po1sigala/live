# Password Generator

In this activity, you will use jQuery to generate a random password when a button is clicked.

## Instructions

* Open [`password-unsolved`](Unsolved/password-unsolved.html), examine the code, and do the following:

  * Use the file above as a starting point and complete each `TODO:` comment instruction to complete this activity.
  
  * Wrap the DOM element modification statements in a function to ensure the `document` has completed rendering.
  
  * Create an event listener for the button element
  
  * Create an event handler that invokes the `passwordGenerator()` and stores the password in the password element.

## Hint(s)  

* There are several methods in jQuery that can add the event listener

## Bonus 

* Search in the docs to find a jQuery method that will add, not replace, the passwords to the page.
  
* Search in the docs to find the alternative method to add an event listener.
