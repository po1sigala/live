# Password Generator

In this activity, you will use jQuery to create an event listener that will generate a password upon clicking a button.

### Instructions

* Open [`password-unsolved`](Unsolved/password-unsolved.html) and examine the code

* Open [`password-unsolved`](Unsolved/password-unsolved.html) and do the following:

  * Using the file above as a starting point, add the missing lines of code.
  
  * When you click on the button, a random password should appear on the page.
  
  * When the button is clicked again, the password should be replaced by a new password.

* **HINT:**  You will need to create the element, append the element, then create an event listener. You will need to use each of the following methods/properties: `.text`, `.append`, and `.click`.

* **BONUS:** Search in the docs to find a jQuery method that will add, not replace, the passwords on the page.
