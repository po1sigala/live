# jQuery Click Events

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug the code for a password generator. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* As a frequent online shopper, I want to make sure my passwords for online stores are random, unique, and strong. So I want to utilize a Password Generator to create unique passwords for me to use!

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser.

  * When we click on the "Generate Password" button once, it should print a 15-character password on to the screen.

  * However currently only single characters are generated when the "Generate Password" button is double-clicked!

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and examine the code.

* Using the following questions to guide you, try to debug and fix the code:

  * Where in your code is the error happening?

  * What is the expected behavior of the code?

  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

* The result should look like this image after you click the button once:
