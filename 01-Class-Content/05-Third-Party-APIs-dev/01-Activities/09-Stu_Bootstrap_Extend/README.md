# Extending Bootstrap Styles

In this activity we will take a page built with Bootstrap components and update the color styles to provide a custom theme using CSS. 

## Instructions

* Use the starter code provided to apply CSS styles so the final product looks like this image:

![The solution shows that there are custom colors used instead of the built-in colors provided by Bootstrap.](./solved-screenshot.png)

* There is a color theme already available to use in `style.css`, but feel free to use [Adobe Color.](https://color.adobe.com/)

* Follow the instructions provided by the comments marked by `TODO:` in the starter code in both `index.html` and `script.js`. Read the comments carefully, as they provide instruction as to what classes are needed and what pseudoclasses may be needed as well.

* **HINT:** Don't forget to use the previous example as a guide to how custom styles can be applied with CSS.
