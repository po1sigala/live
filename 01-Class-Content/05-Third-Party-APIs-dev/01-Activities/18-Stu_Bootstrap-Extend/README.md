# Extending Bootstrap Styles

In this activity you will work with a partner to take a page built with Bootstrap components and update the color styles to provide a custom theme using CSS.

## Instructions

* Use the starter code provided to apply CSS styles so the final product looks like this image:

![The solution shows that there are custom colors used instead of the built-in colors provided by Bootstrap.](./solved-screenshot.png)

* There is a color theme already available to use in `style.css`, but feel free to use [Adobe Color.](https://color.adobe.com/)

* Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code in both `index.html` and `script.js`. Read the comments carefully, as they provide instruction as to what classes are needed and what pseudoclasses may be needed as well.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * Familiarize yourself with similar UI frameworks such as [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), and a very customizable one called [Tailwind.](https://tailwindcss.com/)

* Check the [Solution](./Solved/index.html) after class and compare it against your own file. 

## üí° Hint(s)

* Don't forget to use the previous example as a guide to how custom styles can be applied with CSS.
