  *  Read the instructions in the `TODO:` comments to select, create, and modify the elements

## Hint(s) 

* Don’t forget to “incorporate” jQuery before you begin.

## Bonus

* Find the difference between `$("<div>")` vs `$("div")` in jQuery. 

* Research an alternative method that attaches elements as a sibling and not as a child
