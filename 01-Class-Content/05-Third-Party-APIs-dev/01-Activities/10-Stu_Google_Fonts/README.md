# Google Fonts

In this activity we will take a page and customize it further with Google Fonts.

## Instructions

* Use [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to find a font or two (or variations of the same font) to apply to the page in [Unsolved](./Unsolved/index.html).

* Once fonts are selected, apply the Google Fonts `<link>` element to `index.html`

* In `style.css`, apply the selected fonts to both the `<body>` element and all heading elements (`<h1>` through `<h6>`). There should be no need to add class styles in this activity. 

* **HINT:** There are web sites that help pick fonts. Check out [Typewolf](https://www.typewolf.com/google-fonts) and [FontPair](https://fontpair.co/) for inspiration!
