In this activity you will work with a partner and use the Bootstrap documentation to update an existing web page to make better use of space by implementing layout properties provided by Bootstrap.

## Instructions

* Using the [Bootstrap documentation for the Grid,](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/layout/grid/) add to the existing code in the [Unsolved file](./Unsolved/index.html)

* Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to build the layout. The result should look like this image:
