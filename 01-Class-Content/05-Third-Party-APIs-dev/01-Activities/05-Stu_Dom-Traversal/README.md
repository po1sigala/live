# Tic Tac Toe

In this activity, you will use jQuery to complete a game of Tic Tac Toe.

### Instructions

* Open [`TicTacToe-unsolved`](Unsolved/TicTacToe-unsolved.html), examine the code, and do the following:

  * Use the preceding file as a starting point and add the statements that will accomplish the **three** requested actions.
  
  * Use DOM traversal methods in jQuery to move from the designated starting element to the target element.
  
  * Once the target element has been reached, perform the necessary action to complete the task.

* **HINT:**  You will need to use [multiple methods from jQuery to traverse](https://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/) from the starting element to the target element. It helps to change the style of the element as you traverse through the DOM as a visual aid to track the current location. You may need to use some of the following jQuery functions: `.text`, , `css`, `.eq`, and `.parent`, `.children`, `.closest`, `first`, and `last`.

* **BONUS:** Try to play a game from start to finish with a classmate.
