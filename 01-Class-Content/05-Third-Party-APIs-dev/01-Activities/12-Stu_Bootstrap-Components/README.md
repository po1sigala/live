## 💡Hint(s)

* When in doubt, use the Bootstrap documentation links in the comments and Chrome DevTools to breakdown the classes and styles used!

* Look down the left-hand side of the Bootstrap documentation to see the different types of components.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge:

  * How did Bootstrap come to be and how are CSS frameworks like it useful for developers?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
