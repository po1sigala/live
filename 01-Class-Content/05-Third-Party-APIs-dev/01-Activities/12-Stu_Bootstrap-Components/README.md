# Bootstrap Components

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use the Bootstrap documentation to build a web page using only prebuilt Bootstrap UI components.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [Bootstrap documentation for Components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/components/) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a plain web page without any components.

  * Follow the instructions provided by the comments in the starter code to add these different components to the web page:

    * Navbar

    * Jumbotron

    * Alert

    * Form

    * List (with badges)

    * Card (with a list, header, and footer)
  
* The result should look like this image:

## üí°Hint(s)

* When in doubt, use the Bootstrap documentation links in the comments and Chrome DevTools to breakdown the classes and styles used!

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can look into to further your knowledge:

  * How did Bootstrap come to be and how are CSS frameworks like it useful for developers?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
