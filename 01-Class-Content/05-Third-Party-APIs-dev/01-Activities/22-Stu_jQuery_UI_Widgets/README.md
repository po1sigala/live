# jQuery UI Widgets

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use jQuery UI documentation to apply some jQuery UI widgets to the "Skills Form" to make it more user-friendly.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [jQuery UI Docs](https://jqueryui.com/demos/).

* Using the documentation, implement the following jQuery UI widgets:

  * Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and apply the jQuery UI `<link>`  and `<script>` tag.

  * Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and add the following widgets:

    * An `Autocomplete` widget that will find and select from a pre-populated list of skills as users type in the "Skill Name" field of the "Skills Form". 

    * A `Datepicker` widget that will show month and year dropdowns in place of the static month/year header. 

## üí° Hint(s)

* You will need to add an array of skills to use with the `Autocomplete` widget.

* Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples on the `Datepicker` widget page of the jQuery UI docs.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge: 

  * What build-in HTML feature can also help enforce a date? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
