# jQuery UI Widgets

In this activity, you will apply some jQuery UI widgets to the "Skills Form" to make it more user-friendly.

## Instructions

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) and do the following:

  * Apply the jQuery UI `<link>` element in the `<head>` section.

  * Apply the jQuery UI `<script>` tag below the `<body>` section.

* Open [script.js](Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and do the following widgets:

  * Add an `Autocomplete` widget that will find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type in the `Skill Name` field.

  * Add a `Datepicker` widget that will show month and year dropdowns in place of the static month/year header. **Hint**: Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples.

## Hint(s)

* You can refer to the [jQuery UI Demos](https://jqueryui.com/demos/) to find more information on the `Autocomplete` and `Datepicker` widgets.
