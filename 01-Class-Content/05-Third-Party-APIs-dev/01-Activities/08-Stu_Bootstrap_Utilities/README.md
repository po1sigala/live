# Bootstrap Utility Classes

In this activity we will take a Bootstrap form component and use various utility classes to center it on the page and make it more visually appealing. 

## Instructions

* Using the [Bootstrap documentation for Utilities,](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) add to the existing code in [Unsolved file](./Unsolved/index.html) to match this image:

* Follow the instructions provided by the comments marked by `TODO:` in the starter code. Read the comments carefully, as they will provide hints as to where you'll find your answer in the Bootstrap documentation.

* **HINT:** Don't forget to use the previous example as a guide to how the classes can be used!
