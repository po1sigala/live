# 📖 Implement Shopping List Item Deletion

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an online shopper, I want to have the ability to remove items from my list.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when each item's "Remove" button can be clicked to remove its respective shopping list item. 

## 📝 Note(s)

Refer to the documentation: 

[jQuery Docs on Event Delegation](https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/)

## 💡 Hint(s) 

* Use your knowledge in DOM traversal to select an element's parent.
  
* The jQuery method for deleting an element is `.remove()`.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * What are some alternatives to using jQuery? Discuss the merits with your partner. 
 
* You can read [You might not need jQuery](http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/) to see some options to jQuery.
