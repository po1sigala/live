# Unit 05: Third-Party APIs

## Overview

When developers find themselves repeating a task, they tend to look for a way to simplify their workflow. We saw earlier how CSS frameworks were developed to ensure consistency across applications and to expedite developer workflows. Tools with similar goals have emerged in the JavaScript ecosystem. 

jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation and event handling. It allows us to write fewer lines of code than we'd need to if we were using plain ol' JavaScript to accomplish the same end. jQuery also provides a number of methods for animations and working with APIs.

Some argue that jQuery is slowly being phased out and replaced with front-end frameworks such as React. You might not see as many job listings for jQuery developers, but it’s an important skill to master as the library is still widely used in both new and legacy code. 

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* jQuery

  * DOM traversal and manipulation

  * Event handling

* Bootstrap

* Google Fonts

* jQuery UI 

* Moment.js

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to: 

* Explain and implement CDNs to leverage third-party APIs such as CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, and custom fonts

* Use jQuery to perform DOM manipulation and traversals and implement interactivity using event handlers

* Explain how to resolve issues related to dynamically generated HTML using jQuery

* Explain and implement the Bootstrap grid layout in HTML

* Integrate Bootstrap components in HTML files to quickly build user interfaces

* Add custom styling to a CSS framework

* Implement jQuery UI to make a webpage more user-friendly

* Utilize Moment.js to format dates and calculate time differences

## Homework: Day Planner

* Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

## Heads-Up

* In the next unit, you will use the jQuery AJAX method to make requests to *server*-side APIs.
