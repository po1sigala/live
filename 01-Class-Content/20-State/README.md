# Unit 20: React Week 2

## Overview
In this unit, we will work with complex state management techniques. We will use a combination of React Hooks and the Context API to create a state management flow similar to Redux.

## Key Topics
* React Hooks
* The Context API
* Store
* Reducers
* Effects
* Redux design patterns 

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What conditions must be met when creating React Hooks?
2. At a high level, how does the Context API reduce "prop-drilling"?
3. How does one manage state in a complex application?

## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Articulate the term "effect" in the broader sense of programming.
* Utilize React's most common built-in Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.
* Transform a React application that manages state with a class component into an application that uses functional components with React Hooks.
* Create Context Objects and use them as a means to share state.
* Learn about general good practices when working with component-based applications.
* Identify proper use cases of Context API, while staying aware of its shortcomings.
* Utilize a combination of Context Objects, Providers, and consumers via the `useContext` Hook to manage global state.
* Use multiple Context Providers to manage complex state.
* Create a custom reusable Hook that follows the 2 rules of Hooks.
* Transform an app that manages state in Container components into one that follows a Redux pattern.
* Identify the appropriate time to make a React app use Redux or follow a similar design pattern.
* Grasp general concepts of declarative, pure, immutable functions, in a way that is abstracted from Redux or any particular library.
* Implement a Redux-like store in a React app.

## Homework: üè¨ Online Marketplace
* In this assignment, you will be creating a marketplace that allows users to view products from Best Buy. The user will be able to view details about the product, and if they decide, add the product to a shopping cart.
