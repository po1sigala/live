# Unit 4: Web APIs

## Overview
Application Programming Interfaces are central to creating dynamic, interactive web applications. The first, and perhaps most important, API we will work with is the Web API, and the application with which we will interface is the browser. Built-in to every browser are methods and properties that allow us to extend its basic functionality using JavaScript.

In the previous unit, you worked with the Window object to generate alerts and prompts in the browser. If we inspect the Window object in our developer tools, we will see that, in addition to the functionality weâ€™re familiar with, it contains a lot more properties and methods. The Window object is one of the interfaces available to us in the Web API. There are dozens of interfaces at our disposal. We will look at a few of the most important Web APIs in this unit, beginning with the DOM.

The DOM is an in-memory object-oriented representation of the HTML document, allowing us to interact with HTML using JavaScript. When we interface with the DOM, we are not making any changes to the HTML document itself, only to its representation as an object in the browser. DOM methods allow us to select elements to get the content of those elements or insert content into the elements; generate new elements; and listen and respond to events such as key presses and mouse clicks.


## Key Topics

* web APIs and interfaces
* timers
* document object model
* getting, selecting, traversing & manipulating elements
* form events
* keyboard & mouse events
* bubbling & propagation
* event delegation


## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is the DOM API?
2. What is event delegation?
3. What is the purpose of client-side storage?


## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Explain and identify the document object and its relationship to HTML
* Utilize the Window object for local and session storage
* Utilize the IndexDB API for advanced storage
* Use DOM API methods to select and dynamically generate HTML elements and content
* Use DOM API methods to handle events such as key presses and mouse clicks
* Research Web API documentation to implement new and unfamiliar interfaces


## Homework: Code Quiz
As you proceed in your career as a web developer, you will most likely be asked to complete a coding assessment. These assessments are generally a combination of multiple choice questions and interactive coding challenges. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a code quiz of multiple choice questions.
