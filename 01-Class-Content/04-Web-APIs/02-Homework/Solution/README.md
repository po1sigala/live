# Project Title

## Description 

Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your identity as a developer. Having works on display is a vital way to show your work off to other developers and especially employees. Something many newer developers will overlook is the `README.md`

The README file can differentiate a good project from a bad project. It gives you an opportunity to talk about your application, justify the technologies used, and even talk about some challenges faced or future features you hope to implement. A good README will help you stand out in a large crowd of developers putting work on GitHub.

There's no one _right_ way to structure a good README. There is a wrong way, and that is to not include a README at all. This guide outlines a few best-practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own opinion(s) as to what makes a good README.

At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why and/or how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? The answer is not: "Because it was a homework assignment". What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? If there are a lot of features, consider adding a header titled "Features".

If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

If you need an example of a good README, check out [the VSCode repository](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode).


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is _very_ long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development environment running.


## Usage 

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed. 


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include those links here, as well.



## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This let's other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You may want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.


## Contributing

If you created an application or package and you would like other developers to contribute, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
