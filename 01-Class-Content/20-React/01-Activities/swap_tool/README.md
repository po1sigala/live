# sswap (`src/` swap)

`sswap` is a CLI that swaps the `src` directory of a React app with another `src` directory. No more copying and pasting into your practice app just to move on to the next activity!

## Usage

1. Navigate to the `swap_tool` folder and run `npm install` or `yarn`.

2. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` from the command line.

3. Choose what activity's `src/` you want to move to your react app!

* (Optional) If you are using macOS and have ran `npm run perms`, you can just run `sswap` from anywhere to run the CLI.

## Installation (macOS)

If you are using macOS, you can install `sswap` and add the command to your PATH by running the following command:

```bash
npm run perms
```

After the app is installed, you can run `sswap` by running the following command:

```bash
sswap
```

## Installation (Windows)

For now, users will need to run the application like they would any other node application. Install the dependencies with `npm i` and then run `npm start`.
