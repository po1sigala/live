# 🏗️ Refactor the Code in `seed.js`  to use Async / Await Instead of Promises

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I should still be able to create, update, and delete from my collection of books.

* As a developer, my code should be less cluttered with promises and instead use async / await for easier readability.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a book can still be created, updated, and deleted from the database.

* It's done when my 'seed.js' no longer uses promises and utilizes async / await.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* How does JavaScript know when a function is asynchronous?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could we run this seed file from an NPM script?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
