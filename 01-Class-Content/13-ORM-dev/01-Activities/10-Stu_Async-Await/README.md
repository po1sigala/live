# 🏗️ Refactor the Code in `seed.js`  to use Async / Await Instead of Promises

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to be able to query my database using the CRUD methods provided by Sequelize. 

* As a developer, my code should be refactored using async / await instead of promises in my seed file.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when all of my queries are done asynchronously.

---

## 💡 Hint(s)

* How does JavaScript know when a function is asynchronous?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could we run this seed file from an NPM script?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
