# 🏗️ Implement the PUT and DELETE Route with Your Own Parametors

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an user, I want to be able to update and remove certain books of my choice from my collection.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a book can be updated based on specific parametors (e.g. 'numberOfPges').

* It's done when a book can be deleted based on specific parametors (e.g. 'bookid').

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Which option do you need to use on the method call?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What SQL operators does Sequelize support?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
