Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to be able to delete and update data in my database based on specific requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I can delete a book in my database based on the parameters set (e.g. bookid).

* It's done when I can update the number of pages a book has in my database.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Which option do you need to use on the method call?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What SQL operators does Sequelize support?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
