# 🏗️ Use hooks to hash a password

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to be able to login with my password.

* As a user, I want to be able to change my password.

* As a user, I want to know that my password is being stored securely.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the direct method uses a hook to hash the user's password before it is created.

* It's done when the direct method uses a hook to hash the user's password before it is updated.


## 💡 Hint(s)

* What did you learn about hashing a password in the previous lesson?

* What are 3 methods for adding hooks to your code? How is adding a hook using a direct method different from the other options?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Hooks are considered "middleware" in programming terms. What are some other examples of middleware used in Node applications?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
