# üèóÔ∏è Use hooks to hash a password

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a Developer, I want to write a method using bcrypt that will store a hashed password in the user's record.

* As Developer, I want to write a direct method using the beforeCreate hook to make sure that a user's password is hashed before the record is created.

* As a Developer, I want to write a direct method using the beforeUpdate hook to make sure that a user's password is hashed before it is updated.

## Acceptance Criteria

@TODO WRITE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR THE USER STORY, E.G:

* It's done when the code successfully creates a user record with a hashed password.

* It's done when the code successfully updates a user record with a hashed password.


## üí° Hint(s)

* What did you learn about hashing a password in the previous lesson?
* What are 3 methods for adding hooks to your code? How is adding a hook using a direct method different from your other options? 

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Hooks are considered "middleware" in programming terms. What are some other examples of middleware used in Node applications?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
