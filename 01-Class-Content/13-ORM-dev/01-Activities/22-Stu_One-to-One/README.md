# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of a One-to-One Association

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in these files: 

* [Models - index.js](./Unsolved/models/index.js)

* [Models - LibraryCard.js](./Unsolved/models/LibraryCard.js)

* [Routes - libraryCardRoutes.js](./Unsolved/routes/api/libraryCardRoutes.js)

* [Routes - readerRoutes.js](./Unsolved/routes/api/readerRoutes.js)

## 📝 Note(s)

* Refer to the documentation: 

  * [Sequelize docs on associations](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/assocs.html)

* To see this in action:

  * Create the database using the values in `db/schema.sql`

  * Change `.env.EXAMPLE` to `.env` and fill in needed environment variable values

  * Run `npm install` and then `node seeds/seed.js` to seed data

  * Make a GET request to `localhost:3001/api/readers` or `localhost:3001/api/cards` in Chrome or Insomnia

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
