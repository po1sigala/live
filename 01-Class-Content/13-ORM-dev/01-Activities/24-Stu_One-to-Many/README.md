# 🏗️ Implement One-to-Many Association Between User and Book Models

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a book owner, I want to see what books belong in my collection.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the MySQL table for book data has a foreign key referencing the user table.

* It's done when the response of a GET request to `/api/users` includes a user's owned books.

## Assets

The following JSON code block is an example of what should return in Insomnia:

# @TODO: Add JSON codeblock of returning data

---

## 💡 Hint(s)

* When associating these models, would users have books or would books have users? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * As a JavaScript developer using Sequelize, why is it still important to know SQL?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
