# 🏗️ Create a custom instance method

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to login to my account with my password.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the model includes an instance method.

* It's done when the instance method compares the user's input with the user's hashed password.


## 💡 Hint(s)

* { @TODO Check on when students see instance methods - i.e. Look at unit __ for how to write an instance method}

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How can we DRY up our code using Sequelize's static model methods?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
