# 📖 Add validations to the User model

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to add validations to the User model in order to prevent bad data from being saved in the database.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when it prevents NULL values from being entered for the username, email and password fields.

* It's done when it prevents the password from being shorter than 8 characters.

* It's done when it prevents the username from having any other characters other than letters and numbers. 

## 📝 Note(s)

Refer to the documentation: 

* [Sequelize Manual on Validations and Constraints](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/validations-and-constraints.html)

---

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Run `npm run test` in your command line to run the unit tests. Use the tests to guide you.

* What are some built-in validators that we can use to accomplish this?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What are regular expressions?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
