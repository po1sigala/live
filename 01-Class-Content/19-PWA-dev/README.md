# Unit 19: PWA

## Overview

This unit will focus on Progressive Web Apps (PWAs). Progressive web apps aim to blend the benefits of a traditional browser experience with those of a mobile application. PWAs may utilize the Service Worker and Cache APIs to cache assets and API responses to ensure applications work without an internet connection.

Many of the tools and technologies used to create PWAs can be leveraged in applications that help improve performance and accessibility to web applications. One of the tools are services workers which can be used to cache our static CSS, JavaScript, HTML files, images, and even API requests. This allows developers to cut down on network bandwidth and improve overall load times. 

In earlier units, we learned that JavaScript runs on a single thread which is something that developers need to consider when dealing with performance. Good news is that services workers run on a completely different thread.

For us to unlock the power of services workers, we will be using workbox along with webpack. Workbox is a library from Google that removes a lot of the headache that comes along with setting up a service worker.

With the use of webpack, developers can deliver applications with optimized code called bundles. Sticking with webpack, we will be able to implement CSS loaders to make our CSS files more modular. We will also implement a transpiler called Babel so that we can use ES6 syntax on the browser. Finally, we will have the chance to use webpack plugins to make our life easier.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* @TODO LIST THE 13-15 KEY TOPICS OF UNIT & LINK TO PRIMARY SOURCES

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Implement service workers to a web application.

* Leverage caching strategies to optimize performance.

* Execute a full-stack application with a server and client-side development server.

* Implement IndexedDB inside of a JavaScript application.

* Implement CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE commands for an IndexedDB instance.

* Convert an existing application into a Progressive Web Application (PWA).

* Deploy a Progressive Web Application to Heroku.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

## Homework

For this unit's homework, you'll be building a simple text editor with JavaScript syntax highlighting. The text editor will be a Progressive Web Application so users' code can install it and use it offline. Our application will be bundled with webpack and take advantage of Babel to use modern JavaScript on the browser.

## Heads-Up

Next week, you will get your first introduction to React, a front-end library created by Facebook. React will take your front-end web development skills to the next level. You will get to learn all about components, state, hooks and much much more. Get ready because React is a hot comodity in the software engineering field.
