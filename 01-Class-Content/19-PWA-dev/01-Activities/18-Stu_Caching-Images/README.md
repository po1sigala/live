# üêõ Images are not being cached properly

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to be able to rely on the browser to cache images so that I can create a faster application for the end user.

## Expected Behavior

The browser should load images almost instantly from the cache and not need to make a request to the server. This can be verified by inspecting the network tab in the browser when the user visits the page after the first time.

In your network tab, you will see a series of network requests responding to the image requests with an "initiator" of `StrategyHandler`. This means that the browser is using the cache to serve the image. 

## Actual Behavior

When a user visits the page even after the first time, the browser is still making network requests to the server to retrieve the images.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Start the dev server by running `npm run dev`

2. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the page at `http://localhost:3000/`

3. Open the developer tools in your browser and click on the network tab and notice that there are multiple requests to the server for the images that were not cached.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:
