# 🏗️  Start The Client and Backend Servers Simultaneously

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to start the client and backend servers simultaneously so that I can test the full application, not just the client.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have isolated the existing code into the `client` and `server` folders.

* It's done when I have installed the `concurrently` npm package at the root of the project.

* It's done when I have configured the npm scripts in the root `package.json` to run both servers using `concurrently`.

* It's done when I have ensured that the ports are not conflicting with any other services.
