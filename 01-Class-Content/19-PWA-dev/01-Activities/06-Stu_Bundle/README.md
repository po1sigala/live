# 🐛 The Bundle Command Fails

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I should be able to create a bundle from the command line.

## Expected Behavior

When a developer executes the build command from the command line, a bundle is created.

## Actual Behavior

When a developer executes the build command, an error message is displayed and a bundle is NOT created.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Execute the command, `npm run build`, from the command line to create a bundle.

2. Instead of a success message that states a bundle is created, an error message indicates the bundle process failed.

## Assets
