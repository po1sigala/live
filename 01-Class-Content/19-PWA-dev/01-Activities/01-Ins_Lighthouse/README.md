# Lighthouse Audits

* With Lighthouse you can audit any web page for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more.

* You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, from the command line, or as a Node module. You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. 
  
* <Go to weather.com and run a Lighthouse audit in the DevTools, Generate Report.>

* From the audit, you can see the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.
