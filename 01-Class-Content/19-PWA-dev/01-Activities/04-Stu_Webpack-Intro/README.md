# 📖 Add NPM Scripts to Implementation of Webpack

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to bundle the JavaScript file from the command line.

* As a developer, I want to start webpack's Watch Mode from the command line.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a bundle is created in the `dist/` folder from the command line using the command `npm run build`.
  
* It's done when Watch Mode is initiated from the command line using the command, `npm run watch`, as indicated in the following screenshot.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

* [Webpack Docs on Watch mode.](https://webpack.js.org/guides/development/#using-watch-mode)

* [Webpack Doc on NPM scripts](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/#npm-scripts)
