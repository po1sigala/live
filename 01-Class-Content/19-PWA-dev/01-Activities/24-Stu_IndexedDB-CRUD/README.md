# üêõ The Delete Button Does Not Remove The Card When Clicked

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a user, I want to be able to delete a contact card when I click the delete button.

* As a developer, I want to remove the contact card for the IndexedDB so that the front end can be appropriately updated.

## Expected Behavior

When a user clicks the delete button, the contact card will be removed from the page.

## Actual Behavior

When a user clicks the delete button, the To Do list item  remains on the page and an error is thrown in the console.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. In the command line, navigate to `26-Stu_IndexedDB-CRUD/Unsolved`.

2. Run `npm install`.

3. To launch the application, run `npm run build`.

4. Create a new To Do item at the bottom of the page.

4. Open the `index.html` file in the `dist` directory.

5. Click on a list item which should remove the list item.

6. Click on the edit button and we should be able to edit the list item.
