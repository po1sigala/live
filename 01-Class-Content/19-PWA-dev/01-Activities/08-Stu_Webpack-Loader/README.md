# 📖 Implement Babel and Async Await

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use modern JavaScript patterns like async/await.

* As a user, I want to use the web application regardless of the selected browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I can see the web application load and operate without errors if I were using Internet Explorer or an old version of Firefox or Chrome.

* It's done when webpack has successfully created a bundle in the `dist/` folder.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[Babel Docs on Async/Await](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-transform-runtime)

[Babel Docs about JavaScript Compiling](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What Babel plugin would allow object rest and spread operators to be used?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
