# 🐛 Get the Latest Interest Button Does Not Work

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to be able to use Async / Await with webpack.

* As a user, I want to be able to get the latest interest rate when I click the appropriate button.

## Expected Behavior

When I click the `Get the latest interest rate` button, an up to date interest rate should appear.

## Actual Behavior

When a user clicks the `Get the latest interest rate` button, an error appears in the console.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Execute the command `npm install`, to download the web app's dependencies.

2. Execute the command, `npm run watch`, from the command line to create a bundle.

3. Open up the `index.html` file with live server.

4. Click on the `Get the latest interest rate` button and check the console in Chrome DevTools.

## Assets

The following image confirms that a bundle was created by displaying a success message in the terminal:
