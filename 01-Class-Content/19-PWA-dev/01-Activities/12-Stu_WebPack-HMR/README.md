# üìñ Add WebPack Development Server to a Project With Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to add a webpack-dev-server to my project so that I can use hot module replacement (HMR) to update the page without a full page refresh.

* As a developer, I want to learn how to configure webpack-dev-server so that it can test my project in a way that allows my work to continue without much downtime.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I installed `webpack-dev-server` as a `devDependency`.

* It's done when I have a `webpack.config.js` file in my project that includes the `devServer` property.

* It's done when I have added a `hot` property to the `devServer` property in `webpack.config.js` and set it's value to `true`.

* It's done when I have modified or added some content to the `style.css` file. For example, try changing the `h1` font weight in the `style.css` file and save it. The changes should be reflected in the browser.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

* [Webpack Docs on webpack-dev-server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)

## üí° Hints

* What other options are available for the `devServer` property?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is another way we can run `webpack-dev-server` without needing to add it to our `package.json` file?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
