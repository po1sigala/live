# üìñ Implement Caching for CSS and JS files

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to cache the CSS and JS files so that I don't have to download them every time I load a page.

* As a developer, I want to implement workbox caching strategies so that I can improve the performance of the app.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have installed the `workbox-webpack-plugin` as a devDependency.

* It's done when I have registered the service worker inside the `client/index.js` file after checking to see if the browser supports service workers.

* It's done when I have imported and configured the `workbox-webpack-plugin` to the `webpack.config.js` file.

* It's done when I have updated the `plugins` array in the `webpack.config.js` file to invoke a new `generateSw()` method.

* It's done when I have passed an object to the `generateSw()` method in the `webpack.config.js` file that contains the following properties:

  * `runtimeCaching`: An array of objects that define the strategies to use for caching.

  * `urlPattern`: A string that is used to match URLs.

  * `handler`: A string that is used to specify the caching strategy to use.

* It's done when I have specified a `urlPattern` for `/css` and `/js` in the `runtimeCaching` array.

## üìù Notes

## üí° Hints

* What other caching recipe lends itself to caching of JS and CSS files?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the difference between GenerateSW and InjectManifest?
