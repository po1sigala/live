# 🏗️  Spin up The Client and Backend Servers Simultaneously

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to start the client and backend servers simultaneously so that I can test the full application, not just the client.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have installed the `concurrently` npm package.

* It's done when I have configured the npm scripts in `package.json` to run both servers using `concurrently`.

* It's done when I have configured the `proxy` setting in `package.json` to send requests not handled by the client to the backend server.

* It's done when I have ensured that the ports are not conflicting with any other services.

## Assets
