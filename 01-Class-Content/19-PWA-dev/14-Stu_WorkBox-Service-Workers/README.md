# 📐 Add Comments to Implementation of a Workbox Service Worker

Work with a partner to add comments describing the functionality of the code found in [Unsolved/client/index.js](./Unsolved) and [Unsolved/src-sw.js](./Unsolved/src-sw.js).

## 📝 Notes

Be sure to annotate which of the three phases of the service worker lifecycle you are working with (registration, installation, and activation).

Refer to the documentation:

* [Workbox Service Worker](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/reference-docs/latest/module-workbox-webpack-plugin.GenerateSW)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Why don't JavaScript modules work inside service workers?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
