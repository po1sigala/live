# üêõ Images are not being cached properly

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a user, I want to be able to rely on the browser to cache images so that I can view them faster, especially when navigating a site with a lot of images.

## Expected Behavior

When the user visits a page for the second, third and fourth time, the browser should be able to find the images in the cache and not need to make a request to the server.

## Actual Behavior

After the user visits the page for the first time, it is necessary to make a request to the server for the image. After the user visits the page for the second time, the images should load from the cache making the app feel snappy. This is not the case however as indicated by multiple network requests being made to the server for the images.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Start the dev server by running `npm run dev`

2. Open a new browser tab and navigate to the page at `http://localhost:3000/`

3. Open the developer tools in your browser and click on the network tab and notice that there are multiple requests to the server for the images that were not cached.
