# Reverse API calls

In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer the code to different technologies to call APIs.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* First open the index.html file in your browser

* Open up Chrome dev tools to the console.

* Examine the differences between three responses in the console

* Open [script.js](./assets/js/script.js) to examine the code.

* Comment on the differences between the 3 methods to return an api call. Also comment on the differences on the format of the data that was returned.

## üí° Hint(s)

* No hints, just observe.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * Whenever we do a fetch request, it goes through the DNS system. How are these urls attached to DNS?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
