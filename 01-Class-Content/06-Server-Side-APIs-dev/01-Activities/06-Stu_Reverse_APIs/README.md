# Reverse API calls

In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer the code to different technologies to call APIs.

## Instructions

 Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open the [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) file in your browser.

  * Open up Chrome DevTools to the console.

  * Examine the differences between three responses in the console.

* Open [script.js](./assets/js/script.js) to examine the code.

  * Comment on the differences between the 3 methods to return an API call. 
  
  * Comment on the differences on the format of the data that was returned.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Look at how each method is making a request and how they get a response.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * Whenever we do a fetch request, it goes through the DNS system. What is DNS?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
