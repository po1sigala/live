# Deconstruct Parameters

In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer API parameters.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Insert comments where specified to explain the parameters used and what each one does for us.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Pay attention to the URL structure in the fetch request.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Research query strings and how they are used to create parameters for APIs.

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
