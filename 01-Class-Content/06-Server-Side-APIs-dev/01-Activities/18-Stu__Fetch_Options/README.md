# Fetch Options

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use MDN documentation to implement fetch options.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) in your browser.

* Open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a fetch request.

  * When we send the fetch request, the fetch request should have one option.
  
    * A cache with a value of reload.
    


## üí° Hint(s)

* Remember to use an object to passthrough the options.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Research what is OAuth and how does it tie into APIs.

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
