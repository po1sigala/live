# Create a fetch request

In this activity, you will work with a partner to request data from GitHub using the Fetch API.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open up the script file [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js)

  * As a user, when I click the button, I want a list of repo URLs to appear on the page.

* Go to [GitHub API Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list*repositories*for*a*user) and find the endpoint to list the repositories for your GitHub username

* Use this information to create the correct URL for the fetch request and assign it to the requestUrl variable.

## üí° Hint(s)

* The end points are written after the root URL of the API.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * In fetch requests we use the URL, what is the difference between URL and URI?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
