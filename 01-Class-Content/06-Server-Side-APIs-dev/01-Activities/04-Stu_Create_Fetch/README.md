# Create a fetch request

In this activity, you will work with a partner to build a fetch request

## Instructions

- Be sure to work with your partner!

- Open up the script file [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js)

  - As a user, when I click the button, I want a list of repo urls to appear on the page.

* Go to [https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/repos#list-repositories-for-a-user) and find the endpoint to list the repositories for your github username

* Use this information to create the correct url for the fetch request and assign it to the requestUrl variable.

## 💡 Hint(s)

- The end points are written after the root url of the API.

## 🏆 Bonus

- If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  - In fetch requests we use the url, what is the difference between url and uri?

- Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
