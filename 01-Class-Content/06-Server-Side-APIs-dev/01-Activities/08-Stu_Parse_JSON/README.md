# Parsing JSON

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use to GitHub documentation to add a parameter to a fetch request.  
You will then parse the response in the console.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [GitHub API Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list*repository*issues).

* Open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * Add a parameter to the end requestUrl that will limit the results to just 5 issues.

  * After doing so, run the page in the browser, it will console.log the results.

  * Examine the results and note the issue url and the login of the user who wrote the issue

  * Loop through the data in the area the script js file and console.log the issue url and the user login.

## üí° Hint(s)

* Documentation will typically give you a list of parameters you can work with, in most cases these start with a question mark

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * We connect to these API servers through DNS, but they are attached to an ip address, research how this works

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
