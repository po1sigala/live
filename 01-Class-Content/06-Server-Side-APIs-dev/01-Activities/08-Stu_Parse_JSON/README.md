# Parsing JSON

* In this activity, you will work with a partner to use the GitHub documentation to add a parameter to a fetch request and display the proper response in the console.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [GitHub API Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reference/issues#list-repository-issues).

* Open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * Add a `path` to the end of the `requestUrl` variable such that the response is limited to 5 issues.

  * After doing so, open the `index.html` in your browser and examine the response in the console.

  * Note the issue URL and the login of the user who wrote the issue

  * In the `script.js` file, loop through the data and `console.lo`g the issue URL and the user login.

## üí° Hint(s)

* Documentation will typically give you a list of parameters you can work with, in most cases these start with a question mark

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * We connect to these API servers through DNS, but they are attached to an ip address, research how this works

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
