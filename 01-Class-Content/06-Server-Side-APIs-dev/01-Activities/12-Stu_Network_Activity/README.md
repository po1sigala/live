# Network Activity Tab

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug some broken code using the Network Activity Tab.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* As a developer, I want to load my script file when opening a page.

* When I load my page, the script page should load on the Network Tab, but right now it's not!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser.

* Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
  
  * What status values are show in the network activity tab, which one is red?
  
  * What does that status mean, use Google to find out if you are unsure.
  
  * Now that you know what the status means, think about the potential implications and start searching your code for that error.

## üí° Hint(s)

* Examine the folder structure and make sure all the file links are correctly written.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Expand your knowledge of the Chrome DevTools by researching about the other features the Network Activity has to available to use.

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
