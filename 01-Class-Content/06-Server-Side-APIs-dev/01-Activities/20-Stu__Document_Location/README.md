# Document Location

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use MDN documentation to implement location replace.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/replace) in your browser.

* Open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a 404 responses status.

  * When we receive the 404 status, then our app should use the location.replace method to go to the 404.html page.

  

## üí° Hint(s)

* Make sure you attach location.replace to the document.

* Make sure you use the relative path of the 404.html file.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Sometimes APIs don‚Äôt return JSON, they can return other data formats such as XML. Research how to convert XML to JSON.

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
