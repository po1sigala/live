# Curl Debug

In this activity, you will work with a partner using curl { @TODO LEARNING OBJECTIVE }.

## Instructions

- Be sure to work with your partner!

- As a developer, I want to test the api I plan to use with curl.

- When we use curl, we should receive a response from the server, but right now the terminal returns nothing.

- Open up your terminal/gitbash and paste in the line, then hit enter.

  `curl http://api.github.com`

  - After hitting enter, nothing happens, something is definitely wrong.

- Sometimes our errors do not give us any feedback, and referring to documentation may be the only way to reach a resolution

  - Go to [https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#schema](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#schema)

  - Click root endpoint that is in the nav bar to the right and see if you can find the error iny our curl command

## üí° Hint(s)

- Sometimes as we start our development journey, we focus too hard on looking for large mistakes, when problem can be cause by a small one.

## üèÜ Bonus

- If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  - If you wanted to save your curl reponse text to a file, how would you do so?

- Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
