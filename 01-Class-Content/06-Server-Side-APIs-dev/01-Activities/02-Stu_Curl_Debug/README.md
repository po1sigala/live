# cURL Debug

In this activity, you will work with a partner using cURL { @TODO LEARNING OBJECTIVE }.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* As a developer, I want to test the API I plan to use with cURL.

* When we use cURL, we should receive a response from the server, but right now the terminal returns nothing.

* Open up your terminal/gitbash and paste in the line, then hit enter.

  `curl http://api.github.com`

  * After hitting enter, nothing happens, something is definitely wrong.

* Sometimes our errors do not give us any feedback, and referring to documentation may be the only way to reach a resolution

  * Go to [https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources*in*the*rest*api#schema](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/resources*in*the*rest*api#schema)

  * Click root endpoint that is in the nav bar to the right and see if you can find the error iny our cURL command

## üí° Hint(s)

* Sometimes as we start our development journey, it's easy to focus too hard on looking for large mistakes, when the problem can be caused by a small one.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * If you wanted to save your cURL reponse text to a file, how would you do so?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
