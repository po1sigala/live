# Using fetch data to generate dynamic HTML.

In this activity, you will work with a partner to write the code to generate the dynamic HTML from the fetch request.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) to examine the response in the console. Then open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) to implement the following features:

* As a developer I want to take the response data and generate dynamic html.

* As a developer, the data I want to show in the `usersContainer` is the user login and the URL of their GitHub profile. 

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Use the previous three exercises as references if needed to put this together.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge:

  * Sometimes we need to use data that isn't from third party APIs.  The data maybe stored in json format within a file.  Research how to use fetch to read json from a data file.

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to answer the above.
