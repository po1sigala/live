# Fetch Response Status

In this activity, you will work with a partner to display content based on the response status.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and open the console.

* Open [script.js](./Unsolved/assets/js/script.js) to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a developer, I want to change the content of the page based on the response status.

  * When I visit the page, the page should show the response status when it does not equal 200.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* If you aren't sure where to place the response status take a look at line 3.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * At some point in your coding journey, when working with APIs, you are going to have to deal with CORS. Research what is CORS and how it could interfere with your fetch request.

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
