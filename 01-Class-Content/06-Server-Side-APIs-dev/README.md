# Unit 06: Server-Side APIs

## Overview:

In a full-stack application, the client (i.e., the front end) would make a request to the server (i.e., the back end) to get data to display to the user. One way the client can request this data is using the Fetch Web API. In fact, the Fetch API can be used to request data from third-party APIs, like the OpenWeather API.

In this unit, we'll use the `fetch()` method to make requests, parse through the returned datasets, and convert them to HTML elements. We'll explore how this data is typically formatted, how to look for and handle errors that might arise, and more importantly, how to read the documentation when working with server-side APIs.

## Key Topics

* Client-server model

* JSON format

* URLs

* HTTP GET requests

* HTTP status codes

* Fetch API

* cURL

* DevTools Network tab

* `document.location`

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. How do the client and server communicate?

2. What is JSON?

3. What methods can be used to request data from the server?

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

* Explain the difference between a client-side and server-side API

* Explain the client-server model and request-response pattern

* Implement and explain the differences in making HTTP GET requests with XMLHttpRequest, jQuery AJAX, and the Fetch API

* Explain HTTP response codes and handle response metadata with the Fetch API

* Parse JSON to dynamically generate HTML

* Explain the benefits and challenges of working with asynchronous JavaScript

* Explain and implement URL query string parameters

## Homework: Weather Dashboard

You will build a weather dashboard using various endpoints from the OpenWeather API.

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, you and your teammates will use all of the skills that you've learned so far to build an app of your choosing.
