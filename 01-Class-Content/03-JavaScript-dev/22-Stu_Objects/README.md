# Object Properties

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create an object to store related data and access the object's properties using dot notation and bracket notation.  

## Instructions   

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [22-Stu_Objects/Unsolved/script.js]() to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a coffee shop owner, I want to be able to store data about my customer's drink order in an object, log it, and log a message to the console indicating if the drink is ready or if it still in the queue. 

  * When I log to the console the customer's drink, it should be an object named customerDrink with three properties. 

    * The first key-value pair should have the key `name` and the value should be a string with the drink's name.

    * The second key-value pair should have the name `sugars` and the value should be a number.

    * The third key-value pair should have the key `isReady` and the value should be a boolean.

 * If the object's `isReady` evaluates to true, then a message should log to the console such as: "Ready for pick-up: coffee with 3 sugars."

    * The name of the drink and number of sugars in the message should represent the values held in the customerDrink object.

    * The values should be accessed using dot notation.

* Else if the object's `isReady` evaluates to false, then a message should log to the console such as: "Still in queue: coffee with 3 sugars."

    * The name of the drink and number of sugars in the message represent the values held in the customerDrink object.

    * The values should be accessed using bracket notation.

## üí° Hint

Bracket notation should look familiar. Previously, we used bracket notation to access arrays.  

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is a for/in statement? How can you use it to iterate over an object‚Äôs properties?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
