# Unit 03: JavaScript

## Overview
We’ve reached an important milestone in our journey: learning to code. This unit will introduce you to the fundamental programming concepts that are required to solve any computational problem. Though the focus of this course is JavaScript, the programming concepts you learn can be applied to any programming language. After you master JavaScript, it will be relatively easy to learn a second (or third or fourth) language.

In order for our web applications to be interactive, we need a way to respond to user actions in the browser. That's where JavaScript comes in. JavaScript is _the_ programming language of the web. It allows us to dynamically generate HTML and CSS based on predetermined conditions or user input. And every major browser, such as Firefox or Chrome, ships with a built-in JavaScript engine that runs our code for us. 

For the time being, we'll use JavaScript to write client-side code; that is, programs that only run in the browser. In later units, we'll use JavaScript to write applications to be run and deployed on servers.

Starting this week, we are going to begin providing weekly algorithm problems for you to work on. Go through each problem according to the schedule outlined below. Spend up to a few hours trying to solve each problem without looking at the solution. If you're unable to solve a problem, study the solution to understand why it works then come back and try again later. Ask your instructional staff for help during office hours if you're having trouble understanding anything.

### Part Time Schedule

* **Week 3** - Problems 1 - 5

* **Week 4** - Problems 6 - 9

* **Week 5** - Problems 10 - 13

* **Week 6** - Problems 14 - 17

* **Week 7** - Problems 18 - 21

### Full Time Schedule

* **Week 2** - Problems 1 - 9

* **Week 3** - Problems 10 - 17

* **Week 4** - Problems 18 - 21

## Key Topics
The following topics are covered in this unit:
* Code comments
* Console
* Variables
* Data types
* Booleans
* Numbers
* Strings
* Arrays
* Conditional statements
* Equality
* Logical, comparison, and ternary operators
* for and while loops
* Functions
* Alerts, prompts, and confirms
* Global vs. local scope
* Objects

## Comprehension Check
You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:
1. What are five fundamental concepts of programming?
2. What are objects in JavaScript and why are they important?
3. What is a function?


## Learning Objectives
You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:
* Identify and declare variables containing primitive and object data types in JavaScript
* Write for loops to iterate over strings and arrays
* Write conditional statements using if/else and switch
* Explain the importance of objects in JavaScript and create objects containing both properties and methods
* Explain and implement the difference between function declarations and expressions
* Explain and implement comparison and logical operators

## Algorithms

* 01-arithmetic - Create functions capable of different arithmetic operations.

* 02-odd-or-even - Create a function that determines whether a number is odd or even.

* 03-log-nums - Create a function that prints all whole numbers from 1 to a given number.

## Homework: Password Generator

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

# Unit 03: Intro to JavaScript

## Overview

In the first two weeks of class, we learned how to use HTML to structure our webpages and CSS to style them. This week, we will be learning to make the pages we created with HTML and CSS dynamic using JavaScript.

JavaScript is a widely used scripting language that adds functionality and interactivity to your webpage. Building on a static HTML framework and CSS styling, with JavaScript you can store information in variables, manipulate your HTML, respond to an event, play audio and video, add decision-making in your code, and much, much more. 

JavaScript is also a popular programming language because, as the only language native to web browsers, it is widely used all over the web. 

In addition, the skills learned by a JavaScript developer are versatile. Once you have mastered JavaScript, it is much easier to pick up the fundamentals of other programming languages. 

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

 * `<script>` tags

 * Variables

 * Primitive Types
 
 * Logical and Comparison Operators
 
 * Conditional Statements
 
 * Arrays
 
 * Array and String Methods
 
 * Objects
 
 * Object Methods
 
 * Iteration
 
 * Functions
 
 * Scoping 
 
 * `This` keyword
   
## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions: 

1. What is a function and how is it used in JavaScript? 

2. How can you use the keyword `var` to declare a variable? 

3. How can you add decision-making to your code with conditional statements? 

4. What is an array and how can it be used to store groups of data?

5. What is an object? How are objects used? 

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to: 

* Implement complex decision-making to your code using `if` and `if/else` statements. 

* Explain the difference between equality(`==`) and strict equality (`===`). 

* Store related data in an array and utilize array methods to mutate and perform operations on the array. 

* Explain the difference between function declarations and function expressions. 

* Recognize if a variable is locally or globally scoped and explain the difference.

* Create objects and utilize object methods 

## Homework: Password Generator

* Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Heads-Up

* In the next unit, you will learn to harness the power Web APIs to add complex functionality to your JavaScript with just a few lines of code.
