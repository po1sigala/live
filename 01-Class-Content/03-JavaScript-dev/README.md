# Unit 03: Intro to JavaScript

## Overview

In the first two weeks of class, we learned how to use HTML to structure our webpages and CSS to style them. This week, we will be learning to make the pages we created with HTML and CSS dynamic using JavaScript.

JavaScript is a widely used scripting language that adds functionality and interactivity to your webpage. Building on a static HTML framework and CSS styling, with JavaScript you can store information in variables, manipulate your HTML, respond to an event, play audio and video, add decision-making in your code, and much, much more. 

JavaScript is also a popular programming language because, as the only language native to web browsers, it is widely used all over the web. 

In addition, the skills learned by a JavaScript developer are versatile. Once you have mastered JavaScript, it is much easier to pick up the fundamentals of other programming languages. 

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

 * `<script>` tags

 * Variables

 * Primitive Types
 
 * Logical and Comparison Operators
 
 * Conditional Statements
 
 * Arrays
 
 * Array and String Methods
 
 * Objects
 
 * Object Methods
 
 * Iteration
 
 * Functions
 
 * Scoping 
 
 * `This` keyword
   
## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions: 

1. What is a function and how is it used in JavaScript? 

2. How can you use the keyword `var` to declare a variable? 

3. How can you add decision-making to your code with conditional statements? 

4. What is an array and how can it be used to store groups of data?

5. What is an object? How are objects used? 

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to: 

* Implement complex decision-making to your code using `if` and `if/else` statements. 

* Explain the difference between equality(`==`) and strict equality (`===`). 

* Store related data in an array and utilize array methods to mutate and perform operations on the array. 

* Explain the difference between function declarations and function expressions. 

* Recognize if a variable is locally or globally scoped and explain the difference.

* Create objects and utilize object methods 

## Homework: Password Generator

* Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Heads-Up

* In the next unit, you will learn to harness the power Web APIs to add complex functionality to your JavaScript with just a few lines of code.
