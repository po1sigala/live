# Function Declarations and Expression

In this activity, you will work with a partner to  dissect existing function declarations and function expressions.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [16-Stu_Functions/Unsolved/script.js]() to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a developer, I want to create a reusable block of code that evaluates if two values are strictly equal, equal or not equal.

  * When I provide two values in function arguments, then it should evaluate if the two functions are strictly equal.

  * If the two values are strictly equal, it should log: "They are equal in type and value"

  * Else if the two values are equal but not strictly equal, it should log: "They are equal in value"

  * Else it should log "The values are not equal"

## üí° Hint

Look for the keyword `function` to identify function declarations and function expressions.   

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is hoisting?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
