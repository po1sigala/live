* In this activity, you will work with a partner to write a function that takes in two values and evaluates equality.

## Instructions

* It is done when I provide two values in function arguments and it evaluates if the two functions are strictly equal.

* It is done if "They are equal in type and value" is logged if the values are strictly equal.

* It is done if "The values are not equal" if the values are not equal or strictly equal.
