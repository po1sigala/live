# Function Declarations and Expression

In this activity, you will work with a partner to dissect existing function declarations and function expressions.

## Instructions

* In Example 1, find the function declaration. One partner should describe the code, focusing on the key parts of the function and how it is called. The other partner should write ample comments on the code. These comments can be used for review. 

* Then, switch roles to discuss function expressions. What makes function expressions different from function declarations? Do both functions in Example 1 produce the same output? Don't forget the comments! 

* Finally, take a look at Example 2. Unlike Example 1, one of the functions is broken. As a team, talk about what is different between the two examples. What do you think may be going on? If time allows, discuss how you might fix the code. 


## üí° Hint

Look for the keyword `function` to identify function declarations and function expressions.
