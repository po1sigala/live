# üèóÔ∏è Write Function to Evaluate Equality of Two Values

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* In this activity, you will work with a partner to write a function that takes in two values and evaluates equality.

* In this activity, you will work with a partner to write a function that takes in two values and evaluates equality.


## Acceptance Criteria 

* It is done when I provide two values in function arguments and the function evaluates the values' equality. 

* It is done if "They are equal in type and value" is logged if the values are strictly equal. 

* It is done if "They are equal in value" is logged if the two values are equal but not strictly equal.

* It is done if "The values are not equal" if the values are not equal or strictly equal. 

## üí° Hints
 
How can we use parameters to give a name to the two values that we want to evaluate with our function? 

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is hoisting?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
