# 🐞 Messages Not Logging to Console Due to Undefined Variables

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to log messages to the console using variables declared in both global and local scope. 

## Expected Behavior

When the console is opened, a series of messages should log to the console. 

## Actual Behavior

When the console is opened, an error message indicates that at least one variable is undefined. 

## 💡 Hint

If stuck, try to think about how the variable is being used. Is it being made available to all functions? Or is it only being used by one function?    

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is lexical scope?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
