# Scope 

In this activity, you will use your debugging skills to fix code that is broken because of scope.

## Instructions

* In the first problem, the variable `shout` should be available to all functions. 

* In the second problem, the variable `animal` should only be available locally in each function but not to the other functions.  

* The final problem is a challenge! Currently, the variable `sing` is scoped globally. Move the variable inside the nested function to make all the console logs included `sing` work.  The tricky part is that you should only declare `sing` one time. 

## üí° Hint

Look for the keyword `function` to identify function declarations and function expressions.
