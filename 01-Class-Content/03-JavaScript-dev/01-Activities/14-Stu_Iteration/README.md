# Hello Loops

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use a loop to iterate over an array.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [script.js](14-Stu_Iteration/Unsolved/script.js) to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a student, I want to store the name of five of my classmates in a single variable and log a greeting to each of them.

  * When I log the length of the `students` array, then it should be the number `5` and the array should contain five strings with my classmates' names.

   *When I iterate over the array using a for-loop, it should log to the console for each student, "Great to see you STUDENT_NAME." 

## üí° Hint

Loops are a great way to write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code. 

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What‚Äôs a while loop?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
