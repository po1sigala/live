# 🏗️Iterate Over an Array to Log Messages to Console

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a member of the class, I want to store a list of my classmates and use that list to create a greeting for each student on the list. 

## Instructions

* It is done when I store the name of five of my classmates in a single variable named `students`.

* It is done when I use the array property `length` to log the total number of elements in the `students` array. 

* It is done when I iterate over the `students` array and the greeting "Great to see you, CLASSMATE_NAME" logs to the console for each classmate.

## 💡 Hint

How can you use the element's index and the array name to access each element? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What’s a while loop?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
