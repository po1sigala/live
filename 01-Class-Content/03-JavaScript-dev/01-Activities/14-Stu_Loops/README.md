# Hello Loops

In this activity, you will use a loop to iterate over an array.

## Instructions   

* Create an array containing the name of five of your classmates. The data should be stored in the variable `students`. Note: You can use the same array from the last exercise.

* Now, use a for-loop to console log an introduction for every student's name in the array. The introduction should read "My name is STUDENTNAME." 

## 💡 Hint

Loops are a great way to write DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.
