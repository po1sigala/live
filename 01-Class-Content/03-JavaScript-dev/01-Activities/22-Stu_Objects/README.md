🏗️ Log Customer's Drink Order Using An Object

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

 * As a coffee shop owner, I want to be able to store data about my customer's drink order in an object and log a message indicating if the drink is ready or still in the queue. 

## Assessment Criteria  

  * It is done when the `customerOrder` object has three properties that store the drink's name, number of sugars and a boolean indicating if the order is ready. 

  * It is done when the drink name and number of sugars is logged to the console. 

  * It is done when "Ready for pick-up" logs if the order is ready. 

  * It is done when "Still in order queue" logs if order is not ready.  

## 💡 Hint

How can we use dot notation or bracket notation to access an object's values?  

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is a for/in statement? How can you use it to iterate over an object’s properties?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
