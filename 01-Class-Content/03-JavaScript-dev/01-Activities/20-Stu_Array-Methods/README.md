# Native Javascript APIS - Array and string methods

In this activity, you will use documentation to research array and string methods to solve a coding challenge 

## Instructions

* In this activity, you will need to do some research on your own.

* Start by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and thinking about what questions you need to answer in order to solve the challenge. 

* Then, following directions in the comments, use array methods to add and remove elements from the provided arrays. You will also need to use string methods to format a string stored in a variable and a string stored in an array. Don't forget to check your work regularly with console logs to make sure you are getting the right results!

* Finally, when you think you have solved the challenge, call the function `matchLyrics` at the bottom of your code. Are the performers matched up correctly with the lyrics? If not, try to pinpoint the changes needed to get the code to work. 

## üí° Hints

Look back at the earlier Arrays activity for a hint on how to replace an element in an array and for a refresher on how to access a string stored in an array.

## üèÜ Bonus

What happens when you use typeof on an array? What is returned? Is that what you expected? Why or why not?
