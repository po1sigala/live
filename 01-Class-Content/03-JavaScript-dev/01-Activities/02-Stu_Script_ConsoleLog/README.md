# Adding Javascript to HTML 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use MDN Script Element documentation to link an external JavaScript file to an HTML file.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [MDN Web Docs: The Script Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](02-Stu_Script_ConsoleLog/Unsolved/index.html) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Locate [script.js](02-Stu_Script_ConsoleLog/Unsolved/script.js) in the same folder as the `index.html`. This is the external Javascript file you will link to the HTML. 

* Using the documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given an HTML file that is not yet linked to an external Javascript file. We are also given a JavaScript file containing a pre-written console log to be linked.  

  * When we open the HTML file in the browser and go to the console, the message contained in the console log in the JavaScript file should appear. 

## üí° Hint

Use `Cmd + Option + J` on a Mac or `Cmd +Shift +J` on Windows to open up the Developer's Console on Chrome. Alternatively, right-click on the page and select `Inspect`.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Comments are a key part of a developer's toolbox.  Why do you think it is 
       so important to include comments in your code? How do you write single-line and multi-line comments in Javascript?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
