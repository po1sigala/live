# üìñ Link External JavaScript File to Existing HTML File

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

As a developer, I want to link an external JavaScript file to an existing `index.html` file to add JavaScript functiona
lity to my static web page. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when I open the `index.html`, navigate to the console, and see the message contained in the `script.js` file logged to the console. 

## Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs: The Script Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script)
[Open Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/open)

## üí° Hint

It is best practice to add a link to an external JavaScript file above what closing HTML tag? 

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Comments are a key part of a developer's toolbox.  Why do you think it is so important to include comments in your code? How do you write single-line and multi-line comments in Javascript?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
