# Adding Javascript to HTML 

In this activity, you will use `<script>` to embed Javascript into your HTML file and write your first messages to the console using console.log().

## Instructions

* Under the comment `YOUR CODE HERE` embed Javascript into the existing HTML file using  `<script>` tags.

* Inside the `<script>` tags, write a message that will log on the console. The message should read: "Hello, my name is `YOURNAME`." 

* Don't forget to add a comment to explain what your code does.  

* Now open up the console. Your message with your name should appear.

* Next, think about two more messages you would like to have log on the console.

* For each message, write a comment explaining the code you need to write to get your message to appear on the console.  

* Then, write the Javascript to get it to work.  

* Finally, open up the console again. In addition to the previous message, your two new messages should appear. Congrats, you just planned and wrote your first few lines of Javascript code!

## üèÜ Bonus

Comments are an key part of a developer's toolbox.  Why you think it so important to include comments in your code? How do you write single-line and multi-line comments in Javascript?
