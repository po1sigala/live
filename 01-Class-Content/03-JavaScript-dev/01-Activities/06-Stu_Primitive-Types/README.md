# Primitive Value Types

In this activity, you will use typeof and console.log() to debug existing code. 

## Instructions

* Take a look at the index.html file. The first thing you will likely notice is there is a lot of code there. It may look overwhelming at first but don't worry, you have all the tools you need to get the job done. All of your work will take place inside the `<script>` tags and under the comment that reads `DEBUG THE CODE BELOW `.

* After reading through the Javascript comments to familiarize yourself with the code and your task, try opening the index.html file in your browser. It looks like there are a lot of frowns! To fix the app and make the smiley faces appear, you will need to use your knowledge of variables and data types to fix the broken code. For every variable you fix, a smiley face will pop up üòÉ. 

* To get started debugging, use the example as a guide and work through the broken code one variable at a time. For each variable, first determine the current data types (use `typeof`) and the value of the variable (use `console.log()`.) Once you know what the current code is doing, compare it to what is expected in order to get it to work. Then, think about ways you can change the code so that it matches the expected value and type.  

* Turn as many frowns upside down in the time alloted, but don't worry if you don't get completely finished with this challenge. The goal is to get you thinking about data types and values and to practice debugging. 

## üí° Hints

Debugging is often about experimentation. Don't be afraid to play with the code! 



## üèÜ Bonus

What is != in Javascript? How is it different than !== ?
