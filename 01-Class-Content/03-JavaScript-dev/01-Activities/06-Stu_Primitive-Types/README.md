# Primitive Value Types

In this activity, you will use typeof and console.log() to debug existing code. 

## Instructions

* Take a look at the index.html file. All of your work will take place inside the `<script>` tags and under the comment that reads `DEBUG THE CODE BELOW `. 

* Read through the comments and then open up the console. Currently, all the the answers are currently wrong and marked by an ❌.  To fix this app, all  ❌'s should turn into ✅, marking a correct answer.

* To debug, first determine the current data types (use `typeof`) for each variable's value. Then, think about how you can change the current code to get the ✅ to appear.

* Try to get as many ✅'s possible in the time alloted but don't worry if you don't get completely finished. The goal is to get you thinking about data types and to practice debugging. 

## 💡 Hints

Debugging is an important part of a Javascript developer's toolbox and checking for type will come in handy especially when you are not getting the output you want. 


## 🏆 Bonus

Strings and numbers are immutable values in Javascript. What does that mean?
