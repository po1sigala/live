# Primitive Value Types

In this activity, you will use typeof and console.log() to debug existing code. 

## Instructions

* Take a look at the index.html file. Don't worry if some of the code looks unfamiliar, you have all the tools you need to get the job done. All of your work will take place inside the `<script>` tags and under the comment that reads `DEBUG THE CODE BELOW `.

* After reading through the comments to familiarize yourself with the code and your task, open up the console. You will see in the console that all the the answers are currently wrong and marked by an ‚ùå.  To fix this app, all the ‚ùå should turn into ‚úÖ, marking a correct answer. That will take a bit of debugging. 

* To start debugging, first determine the current data types (use `typeof`). Once you know what the current code is doing and why it is that type of code, compare it to what is expected (for this exercise the expected type is provided in the comments).

 Then, think about ways you may get the existing code to match the expected type.  

* Try to get as many ‚úÖ's possible in the time alloted but don't worry if you don't get completely finished with this challenge especially the trickier ones. The goal is to get you thinking about data types and to practice debugging. 

## üí° Hints

Debugging is often about experimentation. Don't be afraid to play with the code! 

## üèÜ Bonus

Strings and numbers are immutable values in Javascript. What does that mean?
