# Primitive Value Types

In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer code to identify primitve value types.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [script.js](06-Stu_Primitive-Types/Unsolved/script.js) to examine the code.

* Insert comments where specified to explain what is happening in that block of code.

## 💡 Hint

JavaScript is a loosely typed and dynamic programming language. That means that in Javascript, a variable can store any data type. In addition, the type of data that a variable stores can change by simply reassigning the variable.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * There are two more primitive value types in JavasScript. What is BigInt and Symbol?  

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
