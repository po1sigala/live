# Logical Comparison Operators 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug some broken code so that all the console logs return true. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* As a developer, I want to use comparison and logical operators to create logs that only read true. 

* When I open the console, all the logs should read "true", but right now they do not!

* Open [script.js](08-Stu_Logical-Comarision-Operators/Unsolved/script.js) and examine the code.

* Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
  
  * What is the current output for each console log?
  
  * How might you use a logical or conditional operator so the expression that the expression evaluates to true? 
  
  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

## 💡 Hints

You probably have already run into comparison operators in math class! 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is NaN? What happens when you use typeof to evaluate NaN? Is the answer what you expected? Why or why not?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
