# Logical Comparison Operators 

In this activity, you will use documentation to research logical and comparison operators to solve a coding challenge. 

## Instructions

* Unlike other exercises today, you will need to do some research on your own.  

* Start by opening up index.html and reading through the comments. Then, look at the console.   

* Right now, the console log shows a series of ‚ùå's. To solve the challenge, you will need to turn all the ‚ùå's into ‚úÖ's. 

* Following the comments in the code, write expressions using logical operators that evaluate to true or false and store the expressions in the provided variables. If you get it right, you will get a ‚úÖ. If not, try again. Experimentation is just as important to learning something new so don't worry if you don't get it on the first try. 

* Also, please do not change the code below the line! That is the logic for the ‚ùå's and ‚úÖ's. Spoiler alert: While some of that code may still look unfamiliar now, by the end of class you will have the tools to write all the code for an app like this own your own. 



## üí° Hints

You probably have already run into comparison operators in math class! 

Developers must be excellent at finding answers to unfamiliar issues quick. One trick is to look for the keywords in the instructions to help guide your search. In this case, finding keywords in the comments will help you work out a solution and turn your ‚ùå's into ‚úÖ's

## üèÜ Bonus

What is NaN? What happens when you use typeof to evaluate NaN? Is the answer what you expected? Why or why not?
