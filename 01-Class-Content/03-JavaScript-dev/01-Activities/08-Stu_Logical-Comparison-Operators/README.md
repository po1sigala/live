# Conditional Statements

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create an algorithm using conditional statements. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [10-Stu_Conditional-Statements/Unsolved/script.js]() to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will take in two expressions and evaluate if both expressions evaluate to true, only one expression evaluates to true, or both expressions evaluate to false. 

  * If expression1 is true and expression2 is true, then log to the console: "True ✅ True ✅"

  * Else if only expression1 is true, then log to the console: "True ✅ False ❌"

  * Else if only expression2 is true, then log to the console: "False ❌ True ✅"

  * Else, log to the console: "False ❌ False ❌"

## 💡 Hint

Don't code without a plan! Before writing your algorithm in Javascript, take a few minutes to talk with your partner and write out in everyday language what you need to do to make each line of code work. Then, using that plan, translate that pseudocode into your Javascript algorithm. 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  What’s a switch case? How might it be used to build Ramona's app a different way? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
