# Function Declarations and Expression

In this activity, you will work with a partner to dissect existing function declarations and function expressions.

## Instructions

* Working with a partner, compare and contrast the code in Example 1. Which one is a function declaration? Which one is a function expression? Do both functions perform the same task? What components are shared/different for each type of function?  Make sure you write ample comments explaining your observations. 

* If time allows, compare Example 1 to Example 2. Do you think that both examples will work the same way? Then, comment out Example 1 and un-comment Example 2 so only the second example will execute. Run the code and discuss with your partner the results. Is it what you expected? 

## üí° Hints


Commenting out code is a great way to prevent execution of a block of code without having to remove it completely.
