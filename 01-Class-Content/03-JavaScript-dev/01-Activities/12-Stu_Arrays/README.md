# Hello Array 

In this activity, you use an array to store your classmate's names and then retrieve and alter the information using index.

## Instructions
* Create an array containing the name of five of your classmates. The data should be stored in the variable students. 

* Now, console log an introduction for every student in the array. The introduction should read "My name is STUDENTNAME." 

* Now, you have a change to make. There is a new student named Bob in class and he is going to take the place of the student currently first in your array. Replace the first student in the array with "Bob." 

* To check your work, write a conditional statement to check if Bob is the first student in the array. If Bob is the first student in the array, introduce him using the "My name is STUDENTNAME" else console log the first student in the array.
