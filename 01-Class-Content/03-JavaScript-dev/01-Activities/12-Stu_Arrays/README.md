# Hello Array 

In this activity, you use an array to store your classmate's names and then access the array's elements using index. 

## Instructions
* Create an array containing the name of five of your classmates. The data should be stored in the variable students. 

* Now, console log an introduction for every student in the array by accessing each name using index. The introduction should read "My name is STUDENTNAME." 

* Once you completed the introductions, you have one more task. There is a new student named Bob in class and he is going to take the place of the student currently first in your array. Replace the name of the first student in the array with name "Bob." 

* Then, to check your work, write a conditional statement that evaluates if "Bob" is now the first item in the array. If true, introduce Bob using  "My name is STUDENTNAME" format (just like above). 

* To make sure the student who Bob replaced is no longer listed, console log your array. Note that nothing else changed except for the name of the student first in the array.



## üí° Hints

Take a look back at the comments you made during the conditional statements exercise last class if you need a refresher on syntax.

Don't forget that arrays are zero-indexed!


## üèÜ Bonus

The maximum number of elements in an array is huge: 4,294,967,295! Thankfully, there is no need to count the number of elements in an array by hand. What is the Javascript way of finding the length of an array? How might this information be useful?
