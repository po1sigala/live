# Hello Array 

In this activity, you use an array to store your classmate's names and then access the array's elements using index. 

## Instructions
* Create an array containing the name of five of your classmates. The data should be stored in the variable students. 

* Now, console log an introduction for every student in the array by accessing each name using index. The introduction should read "My name is STUDENTNAME." 

* Once you completed the introductions, you have one more task. There is a new student named Bob in class and he is going to take the place of the student currently first in your array. Replace the name of the first student in the array with name "Bob." 

* If time allows, practice using you Javascript skills to check your work. Write a conditional statement to check if Bob is the first student listed in the array.  If he is, then you should logout an introduction  that reads "My name is STUDENTNAME." If Bob is not the student name first in the array, console log the name of the student who is currently first.


## 💡 Hints

Take a look back at the comments you made during the conditional statements exercise last class if you need a refresher on syntax.

Don't forget that arrays are zero-indexed!


## 🏆 Bonus

Fun fact: The maximum number of elements in an array is 4,294,967,295! 

Thankfully, there is no need to count the number of elements in an array by hand. What is the array property used to return the number of elements in an array?
