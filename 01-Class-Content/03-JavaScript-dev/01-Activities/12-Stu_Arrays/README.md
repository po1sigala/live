# 🏗️Log Welcome Messages to Console Using an Array

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an instructor, I want to create a group of my students' names and use the data from that group to welcome each of my students to class. I also want to remove a student who has left the class and replace the name with a new student.

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It is done when I log the length of the `students` array holding the class members' names and the total count of students in the array is logged.

* It is done when I log a welcome message in the console and the data in the array is used to welcome each student with the message: "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME".

* It is done when the first student in the array is removed from the class and the student name is replaced with the another name.

* It is done when I test if the name of the first student in the array has been replaced and if it has, the message "REPLACED_NAME is in class" logs to the console.  Else, if the replaced name is not the first name in the array, the message "STUDENT_NAME is still in class" is logged. 

## 💡 Hint

What is the first index in an array? Is is `0` or `1`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could you use the array's length property to access the last element in an array of any length?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
