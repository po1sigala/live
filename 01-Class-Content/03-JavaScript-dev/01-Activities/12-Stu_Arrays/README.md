# Hello Array 

In this activity, you use an array to store your classmate's names and then access the array's elements using index. 

## Instructions
* Create an array containing the name of five of your classmates. The data should be stored in the variable students. 

* Now, console log an introduction for every student in the array by accessing each name using index. The introduction should read "My name is STUDENTNAME." 

* Once you completed the introductions, replace the name of the first student in the array with name "Bob." 

* If time allows, practice using you Javascript skills to check your work. Write a conditional statement to check if Bob is the first student listed in the array.  If so, write a console log to introduce Bob. Otherwise, console log the name of the student who is currently first.


## üí° Hints

Take a look back at the comments you made during the conditional statements exercise last class if you need a refresher.

Don't forget that arrays are zero-indexed!


## üèÜ Bonus

What array property can be used to determine the number of elements in an array? Why might this be useful?
