# 🏗️Log Welcome Messages to Console Using an Array

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an instructor, I want to create a group of my students' names and use the data from that group to welcome each of my students to class. I also want to remove a student who has left the class and replace the name with a new student's name. 

## Acceptance Criteria 

* It is done when I log the length of the `students` array and the total number of elements in the array is logged.  

* It is done when I log "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME" using each element in the array. 

* It is done when the first element in the array is removed and that element is replaced with the name of a new student.

* It is done when "REPLACED_NAME is in class" is logged when I use an `if statement` to test if the first element in the array has been replaced. 
 
## 💡 Hint

What is the first index in an array? Is is `0` or `1`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could you use the array's length property to access the last element in an array of any length?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
