# 🏗️Log Messages to Console Using an Array

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create an array and console log messages using the array's data. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [12-Stu_Arrays/Unsolved/script.js]() to implement the following features:

  * As an instructor, I want to create a group of my students' names and use the data from that group to welcome each of my students to class. I also want to remove a student who has left the class and replace the name with a new student.

  * When I log the length of the `students` array holding the class members' names, then it should log the number `5`.

  * When I log a welcome message in the console, the data in the array should be used to welcome each student with the message: "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME"

  * When the first student in the array is removed from the class, the student name should be replaced with the name `Bob`.

  * If `Bob` has replaced the first student in the array, I want to log "Bob is in class." Else, I want to log "STUDENT_NAME is still in class"

## 💡 Hints

Don't forget that arrays are zero-indexed! That means the first index is 0, not 1. 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How could you use the array's length property to access the last element in an array of any length?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
