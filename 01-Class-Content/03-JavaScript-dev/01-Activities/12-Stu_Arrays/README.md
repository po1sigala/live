# Hello Array 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create an array and console log messages using the array's data. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [12-Stu_Arrays/Unsolved/script.js]() to implement the following features:

  * As an instructor, I want to create a group of my students' names and use the data from that group to welcome each of my students to class. I also want to remove a student who has left the class and replace the name with a new student.

  * When I log the length of the `students` array holding the class members' names, then it should log the number `5`.

  * When I log a welcome message in the console, the data in the array should be used to welcome each student with the name "Welcome to the class STUDENT_NAME"

  * When the first student in the array leaves the class, I want to remove the name of that student and replace it with a new student named `Bob`.

  * If `Bob` has replaced the first student in the array, I want to log "Bob is in class." Else, I want to log "STUDENT_NAME is still in class"

## üí° Hints

Take a look back at the comments you made during the conditional statements exercise last class if you need a refresher.

Don't forget that arrays are zero-indexed!

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * Arrays are zero-indexed. What is zero-indexing and why do you think it is used with arrays? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
