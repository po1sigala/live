# Hello Array 

In this activity, you will use an array to store your classmate's names and  access the array's elements using index. 

## Instructions

* Create an array containing the name of five of your classmates. The data should be stored in the variable `students`. 

* Now, console log an introduction for each student in the array by accessing each name using index. The introduction should read: "My name is STUDENTNAME." 

* Once you completed the introductions, replace the first element in the array with name "Bob." 

* If time allows, practice using your Javascript skills to check your work. Write a conditional statement to check if Bob is now the first student listed in the array.  If so, introduce Bob using the same format as above.

## üí° Hints

Take a look back at the comments you made during the conditional statements exercise last class if you need a refresher.

Don't forget that arrays are zero-indexed!

## üèÜ Bonus

What array property can be used to determine the number of elements in an array? Why might this be useful?
