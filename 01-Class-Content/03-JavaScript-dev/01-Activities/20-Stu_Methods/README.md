# üìñ Implement Array and String Methods

 Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

 * As an developer, I want to use array methods to add and remove elements from an array and join two arrays. I also want to use a string method to return a new string that contains only capital letters.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when `Venus` is removed from the `planets` array.

* It is done when the arrays `constellations` and `planets` are joined to form a new array named `galaxy`. The arrays `constellations` and `planets` should not be altered.

* It is done when the string "polaris" is converted into all capital letters and the new string is stored in a variable.

## üìù Notes

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN Web Docs: Array Instance Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods)

[MDN Web Docs: String Instance Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods)

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you use typeof on an array? What is returned? Is that what you expected? Why or why not? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
