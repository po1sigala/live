# Native Javascript APIS - Array and string methods

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use MDN documentation to research array and string methods to solve a coding challenge. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [MDN web docs on arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods) in your browser.

* Open [20-Stu_Methods/Unsolved/script.js]() in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following

  * We are given two arrays `constellations` and `planets` that hold strings.  

  * When we use an array method to add a the string `Canis Major` to the `constellations` array, `Canis Major` should be the first string in the array. The length of the `constellations` array after `Canis Major` is added should be returned. 

  * When we use an array method to remove the last element in the `planets` array, the last element `Venus` should be returned and the `planets` array should no longer no longer contain `Venus` when logged.

  * When we use an array method to join the arrays `constellations` and  `planets`, a new array `galaxy` should be created. The arrays `constellations` and `planets` should not be altered.

  * When we use a string method to search the `SaTurn` string in the `constellation` array, the string will be searched for `T` and replaced with `t`. The new string `Saturn` will be logged to the console. The string `SaTurn` in the `constelllation` array will be unchanged.  

## üí° Hints

The MDN docs have a useful [list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#Instance_methods) of string methods.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you use typeof on an array? What is returned? Is that what you expected? Why or why not? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
