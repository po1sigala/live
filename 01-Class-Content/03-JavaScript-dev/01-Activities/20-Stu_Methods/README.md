# Native Javascript APIS - Array and string methods

In this activity, you will work with a partner to usee MDN documentation to research array and string methods to solve a coding challenge. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [MDN Web Docs: Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Instance_methods) in your browser.

* Open [20-Stu_Methods/Unsolved/script.js]() in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the documentation, implement the following

  * We are given an array that contains a strings. 

  * When we remove the last item of the array, the string `function expression` should be removed from the array.

  * When we add `logical operator`to the beginning of the array, the length of the array should increase by 1 


## üí° Hints

Look back at the earlier Arrays activity for a hint on how to replace an element in an array and for a refresher on how to access a string stored in an array.

## üèÜ Bonus

What happens when you use typeof on an array? What is returned? Is that what you expected? Why or why not?
