# 🏗️ Create an Algorithm Using Conditional Statements

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will take in two expressions and evaluate if both expressions evaluate to `true`, only one expression evaluates to `true`, or both expressions evaluate to `false`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It is done when the message "True ✅ True ✅" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are true.

* It is done when the message "True ✅ False ❌" is logged when `expression1` is true. 

* It is done when the message "False ❌ True ✅" is logged when `expression2` is true. 

* It is done when the message "False ❌ False ❌" is logged when both `expression1` and `expression2` are false. 

## 💡 Hint

* Do you have a plan? Before writing your algorithm, it is helpful to write out a plain in plain English that describes how you will use code to get it done. 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  What is a switch case? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
