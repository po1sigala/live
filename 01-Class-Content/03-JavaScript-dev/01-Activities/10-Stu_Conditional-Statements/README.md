# 🏗️Create an Algorithm Using Conditional Statements

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write an algorithm that will take in two expressions and evaluate if both expressions evaluate to `true`, only one expression evaluates to `true`, or both expressions evaluate to `false`.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when if `expression1` is true and `expression2` is true, this message is logged to the console: "True ✅ True ✅"

* Else, it's done when if only `expression1` is true, this message is logged to the console: "True ✅ False ❌".

* Else, it's done when if only `expression2` is true, then this message is logged to the console: "False ❌ True ✅".

* Else, it's done if none of the conditions above are true, then this message logs to the console: "False ❌ False ❌".

## 💡 Hint

* Do you have a plan? Before writing your algorithm, it is helpful to write out a plain in plain English that describes how you will use code to get it done. 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  What’s a switch case? How might it be used to build Ramona's app a different way? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
