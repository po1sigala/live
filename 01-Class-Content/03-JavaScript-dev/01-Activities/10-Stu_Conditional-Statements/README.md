# Conditional Statements

In this activity, you will reverse engineer an existing app to learn more about how conditional statements work. 

## Instructions

*  When you build an app, you always need to keep the user in mind. This app is built for a user named Ramona, who wants a quick way to see her current inventory and build a shopping list. She also has some very specific rules for what gets added to her list. 

* Your goal is to go through this code line-by-line and write comments explaining what each line of code does. If you are not sure, look back at previous exercises or practice your research skills. Once you fully understand one line, move on to the next.     

* In addition to demonstrating conditional statements, this app also reviews the things we learned today so don't forget to save this file to study later on.  


## üí° Hints

Going through code line-by-line to see how it works is a great way to learn unfamiliar code and solidify your Javascript knowledge. Your commented code will also be useful when you build a similar app on your own. 

## üèÜ Bonus

What‚Äôs a switch case? How might it be used to build Ramona's app a different way?
