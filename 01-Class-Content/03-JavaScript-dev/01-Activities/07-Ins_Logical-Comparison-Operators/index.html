  hour and isAvailable. The expression should evaluate to true. Store the expression
  in a variable named schedule. Console log the variable. */

/* Instructor TODO: Walk through how you might solve the coding challenge above
   with unfamiliar terms (such as logical operator). Stress the 
   importance of asking "good" questions to Google and using documentation
   to get the results you need and using comments to plan out your code. 
   The goal is to model breaking down an unfamiliar challenge and introduce
   documentation, not actually solving the code.  */
