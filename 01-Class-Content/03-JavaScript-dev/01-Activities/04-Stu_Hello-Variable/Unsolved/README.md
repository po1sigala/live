# Hello Variable 

In this activity, you work in pairs to to write introductions in the console using console.log() and variables.

## Instructions

* Under the comment `YOUR CODE HERE` and above the ending `</body>` tag embed Javascript into the existing HTML file using  `<script>` tags. Make sure the existing comments describing the code you will write are inside the script tag. 

* Next, convert the HTML comments inside the `<script>` tags to single-line Javascript comments. As you do that, make sure to talk with your partner about what code you will need to write below each comment to make it work.  

* Now, do a bit of data collection. Ask your partner for their name, favorite city,and a fun fact about themselves. This is the data that will be stored in the variables.  

* Once you have your data ready, go back to the code and declare the variables name, city, and funFact. Then, assign the value of the variables to be Partner A's responses. 

* Variables only store data. To use the data, we have to write a bit more code. In this case, write the code to log an introduction to the console using the variables you just created and console.log().

The introduction on the console should look like this and contain Partner A's data. 
- "My name is Abdul"
- "My favorite city is New York"
- "Fun fact: I live pineapple on my pizza." 

* Now, go to the console and check it out! Did the introduction for Partner A appear?    

* Next, reassign the values of the variables to equal Partner B's response.  

* Open up the console again. Has the introduction changed? If you wanted to see Partner A's introduction again, how might you do that?

## üí° Hint

The `+` sign can be used to combine text and variables in a single console log message.

## üèÜ Bonus

Is it possible to rewrite your introduction as a single console log? How would you do that?
