# Hello Variable 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to write introductions in the console using console.log() and variables.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [script.js](04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Unsolved/script.js) to implement the following features:

  * As a class member, I want to input name, number of pets, and a fun fact about myself and log an introduction to the console. Then, by only re-assigning the variables, I want to introduce my partner.

  * When I store a name in a variable called `name`, then it should log this introduction line to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

  * When I store a number in a variable called `pets`, then it should log this introduction line to the console:  "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS` pet(s)."

  * When I store a fun fact in variable called `funFact`, then it should log this introduction line to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT`"

  * When I re-assign the values of `name`, `pets` and `funFact` with my new partner's information the the introduction lines above should reflect the new values.

* Open [04-Stu_Hello-Variable/Unsolved/index.html]() to implement the following features:

  * When I open the HTML file in the browser and go to the console, the logs should appear. 

## üí° Hint

The `+` sign can be used to combine text and variables in a single console log message.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you concatenate two variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
