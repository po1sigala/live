# üèóÔ∏è Log Introduction Messages to Console Using Values Stored in Variables 

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a class member, I want to input name, number of pets, and a fun fact about myself and log an introduction to the console. Then, by only re-assigning the variables, I want to log a message to introduce my partner.

## Acceptance Criteria

* I am done when I store a name in a variable called `name` and this line is logged to the console: "My name is `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_NAME`."

* I am done when I store a number in a variable called `pets` and this line is logged to the console:  "I have `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_PETS` pet(s)."

* I am done when I store a fun fact in variable called `funFact` and this line is logged to the console: "Fun fact: `VALUE_STORED_IN_VARIABLE_FUNFACT`."

* I am done when I re-assign the values of `name`, `pets` and `funFact` with my new partner's information the the logs in the console reflect the new values.

## üí° Hint

*  How can we combine values using the concatenation operator (`+`) to log a single message to the console?

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens when you concatenate two variables in a single console log using `+`? Is the result what you expected? Why or why not? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
