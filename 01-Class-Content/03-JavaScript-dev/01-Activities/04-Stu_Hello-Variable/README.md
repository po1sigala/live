# Hello Variable 

In this activity, you work in pairs to to write introductions in the console using console.log() and variables.

## Instructions

* Under the comment `YOUR CODE HERE` and above the ending `</body>` tag embed Javascript into the existing HTML file using  `<script>` tags. Make sure the existing comments describing the code you will write are inside the script tag. 

* Next, convert the HTML comments inside the `<script>` tags to single-line Javascript comments. (Remember, everything inside the script tags is Javascript.) As you do that, make sure to talk with your partner about what code you think you will need to write below each comment to make it work.  

* Now, before you write your code, do a bit of data collection. Ask your partner for their name, number of pets, and a fun fact about themselves. This is the data that will be stored in the variables.  

* Once you have your data ready, go back to the code and declare the variables name, pets, and funFact using `var`. Then, assign the value of the variables to be Partner A's responses. 

* Variables only store data. To use the data, we have to write a bit more code. In this case, to use the data write the code to log an introduction to the console using the variables you just created and console.log().

The introduction on the console should look like this and contain Partner A's data as stored in the variable: 

- "My name is Abdul."
- "I have 3 pet(s)."
- "Fun fact: I like pineapple on my pizza." 
   
* Finally, reassign the values of the variables to equal Partner B's response.  

## üí° Hint

The `+` sign can be used to combine text and variables in a single console log message.

## üèÜ Bonus

How would you write your introduction as a single console.log?
