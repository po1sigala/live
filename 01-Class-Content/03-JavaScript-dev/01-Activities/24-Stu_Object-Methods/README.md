# 🐞Messages Not Logging to Console 

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* Users should see a message log to the console indicating if the shelter dog or cat is available.

## Expected Behavior

When a name is stored in the `chosenPet` variable, a message should log to the console indicating if the pet is available and if it is a dog or a cat. If the pet is not available, a message should indicate that and suggest the shelter's featured cat and dog. No errors should be returned. 

## Actual Behavior

No message is logged to the console and an error message indicating an `Uncaught ReferenceError` is returned. 

## 💡 Hints

Take a look at each console log. What is the intended input? How can you use the object name and key to access the values and methods you need to make the code work? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

How can you convert an object into an array using Object.values()? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
