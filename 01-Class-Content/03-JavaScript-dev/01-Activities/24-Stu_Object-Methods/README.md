# Object Methods 

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug some broken code to learn more about objects and object methods. 

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [24-Stu_Object-Methods/Unsolved/script.js]() to examine the code.

* Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
  
  * What error messages are being logged?
  
  * Where in your code is the error happening?
  
  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

## üí° Hints

Take a look at each console log and think about the intended output. Then, think about ways you can access the values and methods you need to make the code work. 

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

How can you convert an object into an array using Object.values()? 

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
