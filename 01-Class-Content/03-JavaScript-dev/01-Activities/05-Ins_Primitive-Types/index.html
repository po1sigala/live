    //There are six primitive data types in Javascript: undefined, number, string, boolean, bigint, and symbol.

    //It is possible to declare a variable but not assign it a variable right away. 
    //When that happens, it is undefined UNTIL it gets a value. 

    var myUndefined;


    //Of the six primitive data types, these three are used all the time. They are essential to know.   

    var myNumber = 100;
    var myString = "Hello World";
    var myBoolean = true; //Can only be false or true

    //There are also two more, bigint and symbol. For now, it is enough to know that these 
    //types exist and are part of the group of six primitive data types.

    var myBigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n; //Note the n at the end of the number
    var mySymbol = Symbol("a_symbol");


    //To check the type of data, you can use typeof followed by the name of the variable

    console.log(typeof myUndefined) //returns undefined
    console.log(typeof myNumber)   //returns number

    //You can also evaluate the data directly 

    console.log(typeof true) //returns boolean
    console.log(typeof "Howdy") //returns string
