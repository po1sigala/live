    //There are six primitive data types in Javascript: undefined, number, string, boolean, bigint, and symbol.

    //It is possible to declare a variable but not assign it a variable right away. 

    var myUndefined;
    //When that happens, it is undefined UNTIL it gets a value. Undefined is actually a data type!


    //Of the six primitive data types, three are the heavy lifters of Javascript datat types. They are essential to know.   


    var myNumber = 100; //number
    var myString = "Hello World"; //string
    var myBoolean = true; //boolean

    //There are also two more that round out the six, bigint and symbol. Right now, we'll only be focusing on the four above.
  
    var myBigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n; //Note the n at the end of the number
    var mySymbol = Symbol("a_symbol");


    //To check the type of data, you can use typeof followed by the name of the variable

    console.log(typeof myUndefined) //logs undefined
    console.log(typeof myNumber)   //logs number

    //You can also use typeof to evaluate the data directly 

    console.log(typeof true) //logs boolean
    console.log(typeof "Howdy") //logs string
