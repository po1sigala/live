# Unit 19 Mini-Project: Deploy Contact Directory App on Heroku with Scripts

In this mini-project, you are given a simple application that needs to be updated to use Webpack, service-workers, IndexedDB, and we need it to have PWA functionality in order to work properly. Once we have updated our application with these new features, we can work on deploying our application to Heroku. Heroku isn't new to us, but we will need to work on a handful of special scripts so Heroku knows to deploy our bundled application.

## User Stories

Work with your group to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I want to be able to install the web application as a PWA.

* As a user, I want to be able to add and remove my contact cards.

* As a developer, I want all my scripts to run from the root directory `package.json`.

* As a developer, I want to be able to run in the command line `npm run start` and have both my client and server start.

* As a developer, I want to be able to run in the command line `npm run start:prod` to run our build script and start our server.

* As a developer, I want to be able to run in the command line `npm run server` and have just our server start without the client.

* As a developer, I want to be able to run in the command line `npm run build` and have our client run the Webpack build script.

* As a developer, I want to be able to run in the command line `npm run install` and have all of the clients dependencies installed.

* As a developer, I want to be able to run in the command line `npm run client` and have just our client start without the server.

## Acceptance Criteria

The mini-project is complete when the following criteria are met:

* The application uses Webpack for bundling.

* The application uses a service worker to cache static assets.

* The application uses IndexedDB GET, ADD, and DELETE methods.

* The application uses babel for async/await.

* The application uses CSS loaders.

* Scripts are placed in the root and client directory's `package.json`.

* `npm run start` starts both the client and server.

* `npm run start:prod` runs the `build` script and starts the server.

* `npm run server` starts just the server and not the client.

* `npm run build` runs the webpack build script in the client.

* `npm run install` installs the dependencies for the client.

* `npm run client` starts the client without the server.

* The web application can be installed from the web address provided by Heroku.

* Deployed using Heroku.
