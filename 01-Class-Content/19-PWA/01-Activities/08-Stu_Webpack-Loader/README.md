# 🐛 "Get the Latest Interest" Button Does Not Work

Work with a partner to resolve the following issues:

* As a developer, I want to be able to use async/await with webpack.

* As a user, I want to be able to get the latest interest rate when I click the appropriate button.

## Expected Behavior

When I click the "Get the latest interest rate" button, an up-to-date interest rate should appear.

## Actual Behavior

When a user clicks the "Get the latest interest rate" button, an error appears in the console.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

To reproduce the problem, follow these steps:

1. At the command line, execute the command `npm install` to download the web app's dependencies.

2. At the command line, execute the command `npm run watch` to create a bundle.

3. Open the `index.html` file with live server.

4. Click the "Get the latest interest rate" button and check the console in Chrome DevTools.

## Assets

The following image confirms that a bundle was created by displaying a success message in the terminal:
