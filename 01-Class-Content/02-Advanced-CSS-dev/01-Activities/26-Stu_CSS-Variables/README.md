# CSS Variables

In this activity, you will work with a partner to update colors and border radius using CSS custom properties.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and notice the different cards laid out on the page.

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a developer, I want to be able to update the text color and border radius of the cards without having to change each one individually.

  * How can we declare a custom property on the `:root` pseudo-class in order change the text color to white?

  * How can we change the border radius of the cards to be circles?

## üí° Hint(s)

* Refer to [CSS Docs on CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What does the term DRY mean in web development?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
