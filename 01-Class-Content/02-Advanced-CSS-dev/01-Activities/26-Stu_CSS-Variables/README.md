# 🏗️ Implement CSS Variables in Style Sheet

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to manage CSS values that are used in multiple CSS rules in a more efficient manner.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when any repeated color values are defined once as a CSS variable.

* It's done when any repeated border radius values are defined once as a CSS variable.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* How can we declare CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties, on the `:root` pseudo-class?

* How can we use those custom property values instead of using values that are repeated throughout the style sheet such as `#fff`?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What does the term DRY mean in web development?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
