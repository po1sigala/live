# CSS Variables

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create a more efficient style sheet using CSS variables.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and notice the different cards laid out on the page.

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a developer, I want to manage CSS values that are used in multiple CSS rules in a more efficient manner.

  * How can we declare CSS variables, also known as CSS custom properties, on the `:root` pseudo-class?

  * How can we use those custom property values instead of using values that are repeated throughout the style sheet such as `#fff`?

## üí° Hint(s)

* Refer to [CSS Docs on CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

* Try and identify any colors or border radius values that are repeated in the style sheet and use CSS custom properties to maintain them in one location.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What does the term DRY mean in web development?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
