# Unit 02 Mini Project: CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

In this activity, you will work with a group to build a web page to hold a collection of CSS snippets. What better way to learn CSS than to build a knowledge base of CSS?

## Instructions

* The completed application should meet the following criteria:

  * As a user, I can view a collection of labelled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.

  * As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.

  * As a user, I can highlight a code snippet by clicking on it.

  * As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.

### Specifications

* Must use semantic HTML elements and proper indenting.

* Use CSS variables to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme.

* Use Flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid layout.

* Each CSS snippet should have a card-like layout with the CSS syntax wrapped in an [HTML pre element.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre)

* Each CSS snippet can easily be highlighted for copying on click using the [CSS user-select property.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select)

* Must incorporate a background color using a [CSS gradient function.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient)

* Must incorporate a bit of animation using the [CSS transition property.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)

* You and your group can decide what CSS styles and colors you use to design the application, but the app needs to be a responsive. Use these screenshots to gain an understanding of how it should look at different screen sizes from a layout perspective:

  * At size **992px** and above:

    ![On a desktop, the application displays three CSS code snippets on a row before moving to the next row](./Images/01-app-desktop.png)

  * At size **768px** and above:

    ![On a tablet, the application displays two CSS code snippets on a row before moving to the next row](./Images/02-app-tablet.png)

  * On mobile devices, anything under **768px**:

## üí° Hint

* The HTML `<pre>` element is very literal about spaces and indentation. To gain a better understanding of how to work with it, check out this [article on styling the pre element.](https://css-tricks.com/considerations-styling-pre-tag/)

## üèÜ Bonus

* Set this project up in your own GitHub repositories so you can deploy and use it for future reference!
