# Unit 02 Mini Project: CSS Snippet Cheat Sheet

In this activity, you will work with a group to build a web page to hold a collection of CSS snippets. What better way to learn CSS than to build a knowledge base of CSS?

## Instructions

* The completed application should meet the following criteria:

  * As a user, I can view a collection of labelled CSS snippets in a responsive grid.

  * As a user, I can easily identify these CSS snippets by their headings.

  * As a user, I can select a code snippet to be copied simply by clicking on it.

  * As a user, I can view my application on a mobile device as well as a desktop.

### Specifications

* Must use semantic HTML elements and proper indenting.

* Use CSS variables to maintain clean and reusable values for a color scheme.

* Use Flexbox and media queries to create a responsive grid layout.

* Each CSS snippet should have a card-like layout with the CSS syntax wrapped in an [HTML <pre> element.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre)

* Each CSS snippet can easily be highlighted for copying on click using the [CSS user-select property.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select)

* Must incorporate a background color using a [CSS gradient function.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient)

* Must incorporate a bit of animation using the [CSS transition property.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition)

* Use this screenshot as an example of how it can look, but use your imagination:
