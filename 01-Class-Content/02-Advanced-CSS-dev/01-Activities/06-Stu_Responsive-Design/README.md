# Responsive Design

In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer code to figure out what properties are being used at each breakpoint to make the layout change at different screen sizes.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and open Chrome DevTools.

  * Click the `Toggle Device Toolbar` to open the UI that enables you to simulate a mobile viewport.

  * View the webpage as a smartphone, tablet, or set it as Responsive Viewport Mode and play around with the size.

  * Notice what changes in terms of the layout when you change the screen size.

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code.

* Insert comments where specified to explain how the layout is changing at each breakpoint.

## üí° Hint(s)

* Refer to the previous activities on media queries and flexbox.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What other CSS property can we use to create responsive layouts?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
