# üèóÔ∏è Implement Media Queries for Screens

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As an online shopper, I want to view products clearly on my mobile phone as well as my computer.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the screen size is larger than 992 px, and the product cards on the screen are side-by-side.

* It's done when I change the screen size to 992 px or smaller, and the product cards on the screen split into two columns.

* It's done when I change the screen size to 768 px or smaller, and the product cards on the screen become stacked on top of each other.

* Optional: Just for fun, change the background color of the header each time the product cards change layout. 

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance at 992 px or smaller:

## üí° Hint(s)

* What is the media feature we use to check for the maximum width of the display area?

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is mobile-first design?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
