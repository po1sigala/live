# Media Queries for Screen

In this activity, you will work with a partner to implement basic media queries for screen.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and make the screen size smaller. Notice what happens to the products on the page.

  * As an online shopper, I want to view products clearly on my computer as well as my mobile phone.

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * When the screen size is larger than 980 px, the product cards on the screen are side-by-side.

  * When I change the screen size to 980 px or smaller, the product cards on the screen should split into two columns.

  * When I change the screen size to 640 px or smaller, the product cards on the screen should be stacked on top of each other.

* Optional: Just for fun, change the background color of the header each time the product cards change layout.
