# Typography

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use CSS documentation to apply typographic properties to text to make the blog more readable after a CSS reset.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [Fundamental text and font styling article](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the text on the page.

* Using the CSS documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given a blog with all of the default styles reset.

  * As a user, I want to be able to read text that is visually appealing on the screen.

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE and examine the code.

  * When I read regular body text, it should have a font size of 15-25 px.

  * When I read the headings, it should be 180-200% of the body text.

  * When I read paragraphs, it should have a line height of 120-145% of the font height.

* The result should look like the following image:

  { @TODO insert image }

* Add a few personal touches to the text! Check out web safe fonts and change the `font-family`. Play around with the `font-style` and `font-weight` to make the text slant and bold.

## üí° Hint(s)

* Working with CSS should be a creative experience for you! Your end product should look as close to the solution as possible, but feel free to try out other looks!

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What are some other options for web fonts besides the given basic fonts?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
