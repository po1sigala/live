Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want additional resource links at the bottom of the article.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the resource links are initially hidden on page load.

* It's done when the user moves the mouse over the text "Show Resources," and the resource links display.

## Assets

  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries

  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox

## üí° Hint(s)

* How would the CSS `display` property help?

* What examples can you find of other developers using the `:hover` pseudo-class in creative ways?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 

* How can you force pseudo-class styles to display using the Chrome DevTools?
