# 🏗️ Implement Media Queries for Print

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a user, I want to print from the web but exclude UI elements so they don't clutter the page on paper.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the user prints the blog post, and the form isn't included.

* It's done when the printed blog page displays the links' URLs (but not the header links' URLs).

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's print preview appearance:

---

## 💡 Hint(s)

* To print the URL on the page, how can we use the pseudo-element `::after` to take the value of the `href` attribute and display it in brackets after the link?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is a media query that can be used for accessibility?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
