# Media Query for Print

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create a media query for webpages viewed on a screen in print preview mode or actually printed on paper to look neatly organized and uncluttered.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * As a user, I want to print from the web but exclude UI elements so they don't clutter the page on paper.

  * When I view a webpage in print preview mode, I want the page margins to be set at 2cm.

  * If the webpage contains links, when the webpage is printed, I want to be able to see links' URLs printed on the page.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* To print the URL on the page, how can we use the pseudo-element `:after` to take the value of the `href` attribute and display it in brackets after the link?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is a media query that can be used for accessibility?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
