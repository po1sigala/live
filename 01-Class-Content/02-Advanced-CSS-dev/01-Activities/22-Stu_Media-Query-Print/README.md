# Media Query for Print

In this activity, you will work with a partner to create a media query for printing webpages so that it is organized and uncluttered on paper.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and view in Print Preview Mode.

  * As a user, I want to print from the web but exclude UI elements so they don't clutter the page on paper.

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code and implement the following features:

  * When I print this blog post, I don't want the form to be printed.

  * If the blog post contains links, I want to see the links' URLs printed on the page, however I don't want to see the header's links printed.

  * I want to see the blog post evenly centered on the page with a 2cm margin all around.

## üí° Hint(s)

* To print the URL on the page, how can we use the pseudo-element `::after` to take the value of the `href` attribute and display it in brackets after the link?

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is a media query that can be used for accessibility?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
