# 📖 Implement Box Styling on Product Cards

Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

* As the store owner, I want to display the product cards with rounded corners.

* As the store owner, I want to give the product cards a 3D look by dropping a shadow and rotating it slightly.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the product cards have rounded corners, drop shadows, and a rotated appearance.

* The solution does not have to look exactly like the image below. Play around with the properties and have fun!

## 📝 Note(s)

Refer to the documentation:

[MDN web docs on creating fancy boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto/create_fancy_boxes)

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Look into CSS border and background properties, like `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `transform`.

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What are vendor prefixes and how are they useful?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
