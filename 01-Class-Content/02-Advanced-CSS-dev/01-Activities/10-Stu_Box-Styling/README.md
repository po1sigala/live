# Box Styling

In this activity, you will work with a partner to use CSS documentation to enhance the UI of the product cards on the page.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Navigate to the [CSS Create Fancy Boxes Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto/create_fancy_boxes) in your browser.

* Open [index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your browser and look at how the product cards are presented on the page.

* Open [style.css](Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) in your IDE and examine the code.

* Using the CSS documentation, implement the following:

  * We are given an online shopping page that displays the different products in cards on the screen.

  * The product cards look rigid with the sharp corners; round out the corners.

  * The product cards look flat against the screen; give it a 3D look by adding a shadow and rotating it slightly.

* The result should look like the following image:

## üí° Hint(s)

* Look into CSS border and background properties, like `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `transform`.

* The solution does not have to look exactly like the image above. Play around with the properties and have fun!

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What are vendor prefixes and how are they useful?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
