# Custom Forms with CSS

In this activity, you will work with a partner to reverse engineer code to learn how to override a browser's default styles for form elements.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and scroll down to the comment form on the page. Observe the following behavior:

  * The text inputs have different appearances when empty and when the user has clicked on them.

  * The `<select>` dropdown has a custom graphic replacing the normal arrow.

  * The text next to the checkbox changes when the checkbox is clicked.

* Open [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) to examine the code.

* Insert comments where specified to explain what each CSS rule is doing.

## üí° Hint(s)

* This page uses several new pseudo-classes and CSS properties. Refer to online documentation if you're not sure what they do.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What are ARIA attributes and when would you need to use them?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
