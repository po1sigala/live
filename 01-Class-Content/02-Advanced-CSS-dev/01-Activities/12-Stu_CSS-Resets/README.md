# Fix the CSS Reset

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug a broken webpage to better explain how a CSS reset works.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the page's styles. Note that they currently do not meet the following requirements:

  * As a user, I expect headings to be a larger font size

  * As a user, I expect lists to have bullet points

  * As a user, I expect spacing in between sections of the page

* To meet these requirements, the page should look like the following image:

  * { @TODO insert image }

* Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
  
  * What do the DevTools reveal about the CSS rules being applied?
  
  * What do the style sheets in the [assets/css folder](./Unsolved/assets/css/) have in common?
  
  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

## üí° Hint(s)

* You won't need to write any new CSS rules to fix the styling on this page.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is Normalize.css and how does it affect different browsers?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
