# üêõ Product Cards Run Off the Page

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a user, I want to view all products in two or more rows.

* As a user, I don't want to scroll horizontally to see additional products.

## Expected Behavior

Product cards that don't fit within the first row should display on the next row.

## Actual Behavior

Product cards run off the page in a single row.

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance:

## üí° Hint(s)

* What additional flexbox properties could help direct the behavior of child elements?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed the activity and want to further your knowledge, work through the following challenge with your partner: 

* By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. In what other directions could it run? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
