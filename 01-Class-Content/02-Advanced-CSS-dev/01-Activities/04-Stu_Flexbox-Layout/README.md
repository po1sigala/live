# Fix the Flexbox Layout

In this activity, you will work with a partner to debug some broken code to implement a grid layout with flexbox properties.

## Instructions

* Be sure to work with your partner!

* Open [index.html](./Unsolved/index.html) in the browser and examine the page's layout. Note that it currently does not meet the following requirements:

  * As a user, I want to view all products in two or more rows

  * As a user, I don't want to scroll horizontally to see additional products

* To meet these requirements, the page should look similar to the following image:

  ![The products that don't fit on the first line of the grid are moved to the second line](./Images/01-product-grid.png)

* Using the following questions, try to debug and fix the code:
  
  * What do the DevTools reveal about the elements?
  
  * What CSS rules in [style.css](./Unsolved/assets/css/style.css) are affecting these elements?
  
  * What is a good key word or phrase you can Google to find resources to help you debug?

## üí° Hint(s)

* Research what the default behavior of flexbox is and experiment with some of flexbox's other properties to see how to change those defaults.

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * By default, flexbox runs in rows, left to right. In what other directions could it run?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
