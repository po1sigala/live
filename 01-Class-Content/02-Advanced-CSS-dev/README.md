# Unit 02: Advanced CSS

## Overview:

More and more users are browsing the web from a mobile device, which has changed how developers think about layout and design. Advanced CSS features like media queries and flexbox make it easier to accommodate multiple screen sizes and to build apps with a mobile-first mindset.

Similarly, website design has evolved to include many niceties that users now take for granted, such as animated hover effects, rounded corners, and shadows. In the old days of the web, these tricks would have required some complex workarounds or even JavaScript, but newer CSS properties have simplified their implementation.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* Media queries
* Flexbox
* Responsive design
* CSS resets
* Pseudo-classes
* Pseudo-elements
* Transitions
* Typography
* CSS variables
* Advanced box styling
* Advanced CSS selectors

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Implement a flexbox layout for a responsive design

* Explain and implement basic media queries

* Explain and implement CSS custom properties (variables)

* Explain and implement CSS selectors beyond single classes or elements

* Resolve a merge conflict that results from a `git pull`

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is a Git merge conflict and how do you resolve it?

2. What are media queries and how do they work?

3. What CSS techniques can be used to customize form elements?

## Homework

For your homework this week, you will use HTML and advanced CSS techniques to build a responsive, mobile-friendly portfolio web app.
