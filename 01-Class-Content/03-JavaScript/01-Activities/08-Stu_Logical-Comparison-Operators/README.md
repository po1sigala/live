# 🐞 Logs Using Logical and Conditional Operators Return False

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* When I open the console, all the logs should read `true`, but right now they do not!

## Expected Behavior

When an expression is logged to the console, it should return `true`.

## Actual Behavior

When an expression is logged to the console, it is returning `false`.

## 💡 Hint

* What is the difference between `=`, `==`, and `===`? 

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What is NaN? What happens when you use `typeof` to evaluate NaN? Is the answer what you expected? Why or why not?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
