# Unit 03 Mini Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors

In this activity, you will work with a group to build a game using only JavaScript.

## Instructions

* The completed application should meet the following criteria:

  * As a user, I want to play Rock, Paper, Scissors against an automated opponent.

  * As a user, I can enter R, P, or S to signify my choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

  * As a user, I expect the computer to choose R, P, or S in return.

  * As a user, I want the option to play again whether I win or lose.

  * As a user, I want to see my total wins, ties, and losses after each round.

### Specifications

  * Must use the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` methods to collect user input and display information to the user.

  * The computer's selection must be random to ensure a fair game.

## üí° Hint

* Refer to the following documentation for help:

  * [MDN web docs on window.alert()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/alert)

  * [MDN web docs on window.confirm()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm)

## üèÜ Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your group can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * How can you customize the appearance of the `alert()`, `confirm()`, and `prompt()` dialog boxes?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
