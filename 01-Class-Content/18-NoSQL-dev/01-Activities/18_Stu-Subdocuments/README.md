# 📖 Implementing Subdocuments in Mongoose Schema

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to nest a related document in another document. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have added additional properties to an existing `myAnimal` model to create a subdocument and the data is saved.

* It's done when I write a query that reads the data in the subdocument and prints it to the console.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[Mongoose Docs on Subdocuments](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/subdocs.html)

## Assets
