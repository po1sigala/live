# 📖 Implement CRUD Operations with Mongoose

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to execute a query that can update an existing document.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I test the `POST` route in Insomnia, 

* It's done when using the same Mongoose method, the value `Kids` is updated to the value entered in a route parameter.

* It's done when I can enter the value that I want to replace `Kids` in a route parameter. 

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[Mongoose docs on queries](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html)

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the difference between `insert()`, `insertMany()` or `create()`? Why would you want to use one method over the other?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
