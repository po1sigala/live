# 🐛 Subdocument Query Not Returning Matching Data

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I should be able to execute a query that accesses data stored in a subdocument.

## Expected Behavior

When I query the subdocument using the `db.collection.find()` method, the matching data should be returned. 

## Actual Behavior

When I query the subdocument using the `db.collection.find()` method, no matching data is returned. 

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. In the Unsolved folder, run `npm install` and `npm start`

2. The queried data should appear in a console log. Currently, no data appears. 

## Assets
