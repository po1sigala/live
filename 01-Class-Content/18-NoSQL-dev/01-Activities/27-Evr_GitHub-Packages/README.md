Today we will be writing and publishing an small package to GitHub's Package registry. This is a great way to share your code with other developers and also learn how a package registry works.

We will go through these steps together, but to be sure we have the right resources at our disposal, be sure to visit the link below to use as a reference throughout this guide.
