# 📖 Implement Sort and Skip to Change How the Documents are Returned

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to change the order in which read operations return documents.

* As a developer, I want to omit documents from the list of returned documents and limit the returned number of documents.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the documents are returned in descending order using MongoDB methods.

* It's done the results are limited to 5 documents.

* It's done when documents that contain the largest five numbers are skipped.

* It's done when routes are successfully tested and the results returned in Insomnia. 

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MongoDB Docs on Sort Results](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort/)

[MongoDB Docs on Skip Returned Results](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/fundamentals/crud/read-operations/skip/)

## 💡 Hints

* Does MongoDB store documents in a particular order? What happens if there are duplicate values?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What method can we use to maximize performance and prevent MongoDB from returning more results than required for processing?
