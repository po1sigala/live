# üêõ Tag Population Not Working

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a user, I should be able to see all tags associated with a `post` after running the Mongoose populate method on the `Posts` model.

## Expected Behavior

When a user queries a `post`, the controller should return the `post` with an array populated with the associated `tags`.

## Actual Behavior

When a user runs the application in an attempt to get a post, they are presented with an error:

```sh
TypeError: Invalid schema configuration: `Tag` is not a valid type within the array `tags`
```

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Navigate to `Unsolved/` in your command line window

2. Run `npm run seed` to populate an example database

3. Run `npm run dev` to attempt to query the database

4. Notice the following error: ``TypeError: Invalid schema configuration: `Tag` is not a valid type within the array `tags``

## üí° Hints

When referencing another schema inside our Post schema, what attributes and types need to be specified?

Use `npm run dev` to automatically restart your application after you save changes

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the performance benefits associated with using the populate method in Mongoose as opposed to the `$lookup` operator in MongoDB?
