# 📖 Implement Sort and Skip to Change How the Documents are Returned

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to change the order in which read operations return documents.

* As a developer, I want to omit documents from the beginning of the list of returned documents and limit the returned number of documents.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the documents are returned in descending order based on the values supplied in Express query parameters.  

* It's done when the first document is skipped based on the values supplied in Express query parameters and the results are limited to 5 documents. 

* It's done when routes are successfully tested and the results returned in Insomnia. 

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MongoDB Docs on Sort Results](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/fundamentals/crud/read-operations/sort/)
