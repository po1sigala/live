#  Instructor Demo: MongoDB Compass

* MongoDB Compass is the GUI for MongoDB and is a great way to explore a database and interact with data in a visual way. 

* Open Compass on your local machine to do the following:

  * ðŸ”‘ With a MongoDB server that installed locally and running, we click on `Connect` to the connect to the localhost. 
  > Note: You do not need to paste a connection string in the box. Simply click `Connect`.

  * ðŸ”‘ At the bottom left of the Home screen, we click on `MONGOSH BETA` to open a MongoDB shell. 

  * ðŸ”‘ To create a database, we select the new database using the `USE` command and give it a name. The `USE` command performs two common functions. If the database already exists, the `USE` command selects the existing database for use. If the database does not yet exist, `USE` creates the database implicitly as well as selects it for use.

  ```sh
  USE demoDB
  ```

  * ðŸ”‘ Data in MongoDB databases is stored in one or more collections. Just like creating a database, we do not have to use a special command to create the collection. Instead, we can simply give the new collection a name and insert data in a single step. 
  
  * ðŸ”‘ We use the `insertOne()` method to insert a single document into our new collection, `collection1`. We also use this same command to add data to an existing collection. 

  ```sh
  db.collection1.insertOne({ pet: "dog", breed: "chihuahua"})
  ```

  * When a document have been successfully created, an object is returned. If we have not explicitly included a value for the `_id` field, the inserted ID that MongoDB creates for us is included in this object. 

  ```sh
  { acknowledged: true,
  insertedId: ObjectId("60a46fb6845ecbd2f2736329") }
  ```

  * ðŸ”‘ Once a document has been added, we click on the `Refresh` at the top of the Compass screen and the `demoBD` database we just created should appear on the list. 

  * ðŸ”‘ We click on the arrow to the left of the `demoBD` database and click on the `collection1` collection that appears below. This will allow us to visually explore the data we just created using Compass's GUI.

  * ðŸ”‘ The new document that we created appears in the Documents tab. Note that the `_id` that was created automatically is included as part of the document. 
  
  * ðŸ”‘ Using the visual interface we can explore, modify, and even delete the data. In the next steps, we will learn to perform these CRUD operations within our app.
