# Unit 18 Mini-Project: Student Statistics Backend

In this activity, you will build a student statistics application that uses Express.js, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. The app must feature the aggregate method to show statistics like the total number of students and a given students overall grade. This back-end project must be deployed using MongoDB Atlas.

## Instructions

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

* As a user, I want to be able to view all the students and get a total of the number of students enrolled.

* As a user, I want to be able to view a specific student's overall grade in the class using MongoDB operators and their score on each assignment.

* As a user, I want to be able to execute create, read, update, and destroy operations on `courses`, `students`, and their `assignments`.

### Specifications

* The application must make use of a MongoDB database, the Mongoose ODM, and Express.js.

* The database must be seeded with sample data.

* The API should be tested using Insomnia since this project doesn't require creating a front end.

* The `Student` model should have a `GET` all students method that also returns a student head count using the `aggregate` method in Mongoose.

* The `Student` model should have a `GET` a single student method that also returns that students overall grade using the `aggregate` method in Mongoose.

* The project should make use of MongoDB operators like or `$addToSet`, `$unwind`, `$group` and `$avg`.

* The backend should be deployed using Heroku and MongoDB Atlas.

## üí° Hints

* Be sure to run `npm run seed`, to seed your database before testing with Insomnia.

* Run `npm start:dev` to have the server automatically restart whenever changes are saved.

* How can we use the `$avg` [MongoDB operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/avg/) to calculate the overall grade for a student?

* How can we use the information from the [Full-Stack blog](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/deploy-with-heroku-and-mongodb-atlas) to help in deploying the mini-project?

## üèÜ Bonus

* What is the difference between Mongoose and MongoDB? What are the advantages and disadvantages of both?
