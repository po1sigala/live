# üìñ TITLE WRITTEN AS A GITHUB ISSUE AND/OR JIRA TICKET; START WITH A VERB! (e.g., Implement Media Queries for Screens)

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a MongoDB database to store my data. 

* As an developer, I want to add a document to the database and visually explore that data using Compass. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I click the `Connect` button to navigate to the Compass home page. 
> Note: You do not have to paste a connection string before clicking 'Connect`.

* It's done when I have created a new local database named `myPracticeDB` using Compass's Embedded MongoDB Shell (MongoSH Beta).

* It's done when I use the Embedded MongoDB Shell to add a new document that contains two fields: a name and an occupation. A value should be supplied for each field.

* It's done when I refresh the page and the the `myPracticeDB` appears on the list of databases.

* It's done when I open the `myPracticeDB` and the document I just created is visible on the Documents tab.

* It's done when I modify the existing document to have an additional field of `age` and the field is provided a value.
