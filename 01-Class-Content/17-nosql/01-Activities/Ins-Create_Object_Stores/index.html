You create the db schema in the onupgradeneeded handler. The first part of creating a schema is creating an object store.

The version of the database determines
the database schema â€” the object stores in the database and their structure. If
the database doesn't already exist, it is created by the open operation, then an
onupgradeneeded event is triggered and you create the database schema in the
handler for this event. If the database does exist but you are specifying an
upgraded version number, an onupgradeneeded event is triggered straight away,
allowing you to provide an updated schema in its handler.
