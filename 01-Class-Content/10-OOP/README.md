# Unit 10: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## Overview

In this unit, we will discuss JavaScript's brand of Object-oriented programming by introducing constructors and the prototype chain. Constructors are special functions that are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types. Prototypes are JavaScriptâ€™s built in system, allowing objects to inherit features from other objects. Prototypes are considered by many to be an advanced JavaScript topic and mastering it will be sure to give you an extra edge as a JavaScript developer. Additionally, we will be discussing promises and how to take full advantage of them.

We will also cover test-driven development (TDD). When practicing TDD, we first write tests for application features before writing any code. Then, we write only the minimum amount of code needed to make the tests pass and repeat this process until the application is complete. Test-driven development has numerous benefits but ultimately helps us write more understandable and maintainable code.

We will conclude this unit with an introduction to modern class syntax and inheritance. ES6 introduced a `class` keyword which allows us to create objects using class structures similar to those found in other OOP programming languages. Under the hood, classes are just constructor functions with more intuitive syntax. They allow us to implement more advanced OOP patterns such as inheritance without needing to understand all of the nuances of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance system.

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Create more scalable applications that follow the OOP paradigm.

* Use constructor functions to create new objects.

* Use prototypical inheritance to add methods to objects.

* Explain polymorphism through method overloading.

* Implement Promise.all() to wait for multiple API calls.

* Verify your code works as intended through the use of automated tests.

* Build applications using test-driven-development, writing tests before implementing functionality.

* Implement ES6 classes to create new instances of objects.

* Extend basic classes with additional functionality

* Implement multiple classes with differing purposes to practice the OOP paradigm.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

* [01: Linear Search](./03-Algorithms/01-linear-search)

* [02: Is Unique](./03-Algorithms/02-is-unique)

* [03: Is Anagram](./03-Algorithms/03-is-anagram)

  * ðŸ“¹ [Let's Code Is Anagram!](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/8hnpk2wu29)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

In this unit's homework, you will create an application which generates HTML files using input from a command line interface. The application will gather information about your team or organization. You will be able to add as many team members as you want.
