# Unit 10: Object Oriented Programming and TDD

## Overview

In this unit, we will discuss JavaScript's brand of OOP by introducing constructors and the prototype chain. Constructors are special functions that are extremely useful in creating objects of similar types. Prototypes are JavaScriptâ€™s built in system, allowing objects to inherit features from other objects. Prototypes are considered by many to be an advanced JavaScript topic and mastering it will be sure to give you an extra edge as a JavaScript developer.

We will cover test driven-development (TDD), a practice where application requirements are turned into specific automated test cases. Then code is written to make tests pass and fulfill the laid out requirements. Test-driven development has numerous benefits but ultimately helps us write more maintainable code.

We will conclude this unit with an introduction to modern class syntax and inheritance. ES6 introduced a `class` keyword which allows us to create objects using class structures similar to those found in other OOP programming languages. Under the hood, classes are just constructor functions with more intuitive syntax. They allow us to implement more advanced OOP patterns such as inheritance without needing to understand all of the nuances of JavaScript's prototypal inheritance system.

## Key Topics

* Objects

* this

* Callbacks

* Constructors

* Prototypes

* TDD

* Unit Tests

* Classes

* Inheritance

## Comprehension Check

You will be employer-ready if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is a constructor function and how would you use one?

2. What is the difference between classical inheritance and prototypal inheritance?

3. What are some benefits of test-driven development?

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to:

* Integrate constructor functions into your applications, reducing the amount of code you have to write.

* Write automated tests and implement code based off of requirements laid out by automated tests.

* Create applications that can scale easily because their objects are dynamically created with constructor functions.
