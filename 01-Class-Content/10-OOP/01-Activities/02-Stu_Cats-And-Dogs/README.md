# Cats and Dogs

In this activity you will make a cat object and dog object each with three keys.

## Instructions

* Make a dogs object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of true

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs

* Next make a cats object with three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of false

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats

* Make the dog bark

* Make the cat meow

## üèÜBONUS 

* Create a function called "massHysteria" which takes in both the cats and the dogs object and prints "DOGS AND CATS LIVING TOGETHER! MASS HYSTERIA!" if both of the `raining` keys are equal to true.

* See if there is anyway to further optimize your code.

# üèóÔ∏è Create Objects for Cats and Dogs

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to feel comfortable using and implementing objects

* As a developer, I want to add key value pairs inside objects
  
* As a developer, I want to add methods inside objects and be able to invoke them

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when my code contains a object `dogs` that contains three keys:
  * raining
  * noise
