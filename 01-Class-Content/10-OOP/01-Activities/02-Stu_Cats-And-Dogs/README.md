# üèóÔ∏è Create `Cat` and `Dog` Objects

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to feel comfortable using and implementing objects

* As a developer, I want to add key value pairs inside objects
  
* As a developer, I want to add methods inside objects and be able to invoke them

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when my code contains a object `dogs` that contains three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of true.

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Woof!"

  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which logs the noise to the screen if it is raining dogs.
  
* It's done when my code contains a object `cats` that contains three keys:

  * First key called "raining" with a value of false.

  * Second key called "noise" with a value of "Meow!"
  
  * Third key called "makeNoise" which contains a function which console.logs the noise to the screen if it is raining cats.

* It's done when I make the dog bark.

## üí° Hints

Does the syntax for creating a function inside of an object differ from how we define functions in the global scope?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Create a method called "massHysteria" on the prototype chain which takes in both objects and prints a message to the screen if ".raining" is true for both objects.
