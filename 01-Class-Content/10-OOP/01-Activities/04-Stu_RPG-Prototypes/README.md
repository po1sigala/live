# üèóÔ∏è Create Characters with Prototypes

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a game developer, I want to generate RPG characters using Objects and prototypes.

* As a game developer, I need to create simplistic characters for an RPG using constructor functions.

## Acceptance Criteria
  
* It's done when I have added three methods via prototype:

  * `IsAlive`: Function which prints whether or not this character is alive by looking into their HP and determining whether they are above or below zero.

  * `Attack`: Function which takes in a second character and subtracts this character's strength from their HP.

  * `LevelUp`: Function which increases this character's Age by 1, their Strength by 5, and their HitPoints by 25.

## üí° Hints

How can we find out how to create additional methods using the prototype chain?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How are methods created in the constructor different than methods created via prototype?
