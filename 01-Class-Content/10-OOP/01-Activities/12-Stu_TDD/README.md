# üèóÔ∏è Implement Tests

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create tests to define and test the expected output for code that hasn't been implemented yet. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have written a test for the `reverse` method.
  * The `reverse` method should take a string as an argument and return a new reversed version of the string. e.g. "Hello" should return "elloH".

* It's done when I have written a test for the `isPalindrome` method.
  * `isPalindrome` should take a string as an argument and return the boolean `true` if the provided string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word that is the same backwards as it is forwards, e.g. "racecar". Return `false` is the string is not a palindrome.
  
* It's done when I have written a test for the `capitalize` method.
  * The `capitalize` method should take a string as an argument and return a new string with the first letter of each word capitalized. e.g. "hello world!" should return "Hello World!".

* **Important**: Write code for the tests only; the only file you will be modifying is `Unsolved/test/algo.test.js`. Initially all of your tests will fail since these methods are empty, but using the tests you can define how each method _should_ work.

## üí° Hints

* How can we use the `describe`, `it` and `expect` functions in Jest to aid to check for expected behavior?

* Is it normal for all the tests be fail at first? If so, why?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Where can you find some examples of well written tests?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
