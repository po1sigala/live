# 🏗️ Implement Code to Make Tests Pass

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write code that will allow my tests to pass

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have written code for function in `algo.js`.

* It's done when I have ran `npm run test` in the terminal to verify that I correctly implemented each method before moving on.

* It's done when the tests in `tests/algo.test.js` pass.

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the tests themselves in `tests/algo.test.js` to give us clues on how to write our function?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What part of our code in the `/Unsolved` folder is telling node what to do when we run `npm run test`

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
