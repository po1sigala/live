# 🏗️ Implement Code to Make Tests Pass

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to write code that will allow my tests to pass

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have written code for function in `algo.js`.

* It's done when I can run `npm run test` in the terminal to verify that I correctly implemented each method before moving on.

* It's done when the tests in `tests/algo.test.js` pass.

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the tests themselves in `tests/algo.test.js` to give us clues on how to write our function?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How are ATDD and BDD similar to and/or different from TDD?
