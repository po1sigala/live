# üèóÔ∏è Refactor Function to use Promises

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to write asynchronous functions in a cleaner and easier to read fashion using promises.

* As a developer, I want to have the ability to refactor functions that use callbacks to instead return a promise. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I refactor the function using callbacks, `practiceCoding`, inside of `practiceCodingPromise`.

* It's done when `practiceCodingPromise` returns a promise.

* It is complete when the function `practiceCodingPromise` is called using the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods. 


## üí° Hints

* How can we use the resolve method to handle a fulfillment of the promise?
* How can we use the reject method to handle the failure of a promise?
* How do promises in real life relate to promises in javascript?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How could we resolve multiple promises at once?
