# üèóÔ∏è Implement Polymorphism Using Method Overloading

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to understand the concept of polymorphism by writing code that utilizes method overloading.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have examined the code in [index.js](./Unsolved/index.js).

* It's done when I create logic to return a letter grade if a number grade was passed into the `displayGrade` method.

    * For example, if the user passes in `95` the method should return a string, "A", indicating the letter grade.
  
* It's done when I create logic to return a range of possible percentages if a letter grade was passed into the `displayGrade` method.

    * For example, if the user passes in `B` the method should return a string, "80 - 89", indicating the range of the grade percentage.
    
* It's done when I have created a new instance of `Student` and tested both outcomes.

## üí° Hints

* Our method is going to be returning a string, so how can we get that to show up in the terminal when we call the method?

* How can we use switch statements to help code out the solution? We also have a `inRange` helper function that is provided to us. How might that come in handy?

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Think of another method that you could implement that would use the parameters of the method to behave a certain way. How could you check the number of arguments that were passed to a method?
