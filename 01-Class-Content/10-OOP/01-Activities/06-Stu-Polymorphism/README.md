# 🐛 Implement Polymorphism Using Method Overloading

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want to understand the concept of polymorphism by writing code that utilizes method overloading.

## Expected Behavior

* When the user passes in a number grade, like `95`, into the `displayGrade` method, the method should return a string indicating the letter grade, like `A`.

* When the user passes in a letter grade, like `B`, into the `displayGrade` method, the method should return a string indicating the range of the grade percentage, like `80-89`. 

## Actual Behavior

When the user passes in a number grade or letter grade, the method returns `undefined`

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Run `node index.js` from the command line.

## 💡 Hints

* We are given an `inRange` helper function. How might that come in handy?

* How can we use switch statements to help code out the solution? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Think of another method that you could implement that would use the parameters of the method to behave a certain way. How could you check the number of arguments that were passed to a method?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
