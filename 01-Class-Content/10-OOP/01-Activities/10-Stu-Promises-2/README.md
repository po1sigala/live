# 🏗️ Implement Promise.all()

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to resolve multiple promises at once using `Promise.all()`

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the promise is rejected if the movie is too long (aka. `movieDuration`)

* It's done when the promise is resolved if the length is acceptable

* It's complete when we map through each movie duration and push a `watchMovie()` call to the promises array
  
* It's done when we call `Promise.all()` by passing our array `promises`
  
* It's done when we have a `.then()` and `.catch()` statement for our `Promise.all()`

## 💡 Hints

What variable could you change that is provided to you that would cause the `reject()` call to be executed?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is the state of each promise after the `setTimeout` has began but before it has ended?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
