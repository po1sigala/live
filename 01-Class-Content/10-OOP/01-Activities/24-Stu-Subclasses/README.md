# üèóÔ∏è Write and Implement Subclasses

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer I want to extend basic vehicle classes with additional functionality. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have opened [vehicle.js](Unsolved/vehicle.js) and familiarized myself with the Vehicle class.

* It's done when I understand that all vehicles have `id`, `numberOfWheels`, and `sound` properties. 
  
* It's done when I understand that `printInfo` prints the id and number of wheels on the vehicle.

* It's done when I have created a `Car` class that extends the `Vehicle` class.

* It's done when I have added the following features to the `Car` class:
  * A `color` property
  * A passengers property
  * A `checkPassengers()` method that checks to see if there are 4 or less passengers. If not, `console.log` that there are too many passengers.
  * A `useHorn` method that prints the car's sound to the console.

* It's done when I have added the following features to the `Boat` class:
  * A crew property
  * A `crewSoundOff()` method that prints each member of the crew to the console.
  * A `useHorn` method that prints the boat's sound to the console.

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we add additional methods to the `Boat` class after it has been created?
