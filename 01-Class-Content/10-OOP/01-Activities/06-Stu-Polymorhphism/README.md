# 🏗️ Implement Object Instances with Polymorphism

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use *polymorphism* to create objects that have mostly similar functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the app creates multiple subclasses that extend "Developer".
* Each should have that have the ability to inherit a `sayHi` method from the parent
* It's done when I have creating derivative objects from a parent object that have one unique method of their own

## 💡 Hints

* Look up the `extends` keyword to see how you can inherit methods from a parent class

* The `super` method calls to the parent class's constructor allowing you to access variables and methods
  
* Derivative objects can add additional functionality


## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Add another method outside of the class using the prototype
