# 🏗️ Implement our First Mock

* As a developer, I want to be able to spy on the output of the `console.log` method.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have taken a moment to examine the code in `Unsolved/child.js` and `Unsolved/dayCare.js`.

* It's done when I add code to spy on the `console.log` method to ensure that it is called when expected with the correct arguments.

## 💡 Hints

How can we use the previous example to guide us in this activity?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Use the [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/jest-object#jestspyonobject-methodname) to explain two or three other methods that can be used in conjunction with `.spyOn`.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
