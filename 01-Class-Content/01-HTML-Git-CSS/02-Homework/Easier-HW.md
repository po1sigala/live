# Unit 01 HTML, CSS and Git Homework (Easier): Building a Wireframe

_If you see this task as too simple or if you finish it within three hours, attempt the second homework assignment._

Build a web design skeleton using HTML/CSS.

* Create a new GitHub repository and clone it to your computer.

* Inside the repo folder on your computer, create the following files: `index.html` and `style.css`.

* Recreate the design below using HTML/CSS:

![final layout](./Assets/Images/Easier-Layout.png)

* All of your HTML should be inside of the `index.html` file.

* All of your CSS should be inside of the `style.css` file.

* Your HTML should have each of the following sections:

   * Header
   * Nav
   * Aside (With a Heading)
   * Section (With a Heading)
   * Article (With a Heading) contained within the Section
   * Headers contained within the Article
   * Paragraph contained within the Article

* Your CSS should have styles for each of the following elements:

   * Body
     * font-family: 'Arial', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, sans-serif;
     * color: '#777'
     * background: '#777'
     * width: '960px'
     * font-size: '18px'
   * Header, Nav, Section, Aside, and Footer
     * background: '#ebebeb'
   * Article
     * color: '#ebebeb',
     * background: '#777'
   * h1 and p
     * color: '#777',
     * background: '#ebebeb'
     
* The width of the section should be:
   * section: 495px

* Review these concepts: `float`, `padding`, `margin`, `display`, `overflow`, `clear` and `text-align`.

## User Story

AS A web developer

I WANT to create a wireframe

SO THAT I can visualize the layout for an application

## Business Context

Wireframes are created early in the development process to help visualize the layout of an application before design and content are added. A wireframe provides a blueprint for a website that a developer can review with a client. This also allows a developer to make changes to the structure of a website before an application moves forward.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a developer creates a skeletal framework

WHEN building a wireframe

THEN they are able to visualize the layout for an application

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

* Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills.

* Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state.

Follow these guidelines for committing:

* Make single-purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits.

* Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history.

* Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!).

* Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process.

We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

* The URL of the deployed application

* The URL of the GitHub repository
