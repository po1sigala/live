# 🏗️ Implement Linear Search Algorithm

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to find the position of a value in a set of data.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the search algorithm function can accept an input array and value to find.

* It's done when the search algorithm returns the position of the value we are searching for.

* It's done when the search algorithm returns `-1` to indicate the value is not in the set of data.
