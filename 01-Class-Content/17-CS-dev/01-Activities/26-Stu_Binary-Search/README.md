# 🐛 Binary Search Algorithm Not Passing Tests

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* The unit tests that check for correct and incorrect algorithm output don't pass.

## Expected Behavior

When we run our unit tests to test our binary search function, the defined tests should pass.

## Actual Behavior

When we run our unit tests, the defined tests don't pass.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. From the [Unsolved](./Unsolved) directory, run `npm install` in the command line.

2. Run `npm run test` from the command line to run unit tests.

3. The tests defined in the `__tests__` directory do not pass.

## 💡 Hints

How can the unit test descriptions help us determine what the function is or isn't doing?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What is worst possible Big-O complexity an algorithm can have? What is the best?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
