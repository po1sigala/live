# üêõ My factory function is giving me undefined values when I call the inner function

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue(s):

* As a developer, I want the inner function of my factory function to correctly log the variables when called.

## Expected Behavior

When a user calls the `greet` method on the `User` function, the values should be correctly displayed in the console.

## Actual Behavior

When a user calls the `greet` method on the `User` function, they see undefined values instead of the `name` and `age`.

@TODO IF APPLICABLE: 
## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. Create a new user variable and assign it to the `User` function. 

2. Call the `greet` method on the newly created user variable.

3. Check console to see undefined values.

## üí° Hints

What is the context of `this` when inside of a factory function?

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Where is 'this' bound to in a factory function?
