# 🐛 Fix the SyntaxError that Makes the Variable Undefined

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to pass all the tests in jest.

* As a developer, I want the function to return the correct values.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the jest tests are successful.

* It's done when the function returns the correct values.

## 📝 Note(s)

Refer to the documentation: 

* [The scope.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)

---

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Is the accessibility of the variables determined by context?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens to the keyword `this` in the functional execution context?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
