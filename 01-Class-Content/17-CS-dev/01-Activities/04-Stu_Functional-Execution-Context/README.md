# 🐛 Three tests fail due to ReferenceError

Work with a partner to resolve the following issue:

* The unit tests for the function does not pass.

## Expected Behavior

* When we run our unit tests to test our function, the defined tests should pass.

## Actual Behavior

* When we run our unit tests, the defined tests don't pass.

## Steps to Reproduce the Problem

1. From the [Unsolved](./Unsolved) directory, run `npm install` in the command line.

2. Run `npm run test` from the command line to run the unit test.

3. The test defined in the `__tests__` directory does not pass.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* How can the unit test descriptions help us determine what the function is or isn't doing?

## 🏆 Bonus

* If you have fully completed the above tasks, here is something you and your partner can work through as an added challenge to further your knowledge:

  * What happens to the keyword `this` in Node.js in the global context?

* Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research the above.
