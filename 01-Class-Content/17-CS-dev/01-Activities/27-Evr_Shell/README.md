# Shell Scripting

## Introduction

@TODO: Write introduction paragraph reminding learners about how they've used the shell and how it can be used.

* Mention how we've used it, pose question about "how does our command line know what `git`, `node`, or `npm` even mean?"

* Provide backstory about bash (Bourne Again Shell) and now macOS uses ZSH instead, but isn't too different from bash

* 

## Our First Script

## Build a Script That Accepts Command Line Arguments
