# 🏗️ Create a couter function that uses a private variable

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a receptionist at a hotel, I need a way to keep track of how many guests enter the building.

* As a developer, I need to use closures to have access to a private `count` variable.

## Acceptance Criteria

@TODO WRITE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR THE USER STORY; e.g.:

* It's done when the `Counter` function correctly increments by one.

* It's done when I can only access the `count` variable from within the `Counter` function.

## 💡 Hints

When is a closure created? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:
