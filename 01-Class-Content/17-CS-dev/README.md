# Unit 17: Computer Science For JavaScript

## Overview:

In this unit we are going to take a look at how computer science relates to JavaScript in order to prepare you for the technical interview process that every developer will face. Some of these topics may feel abstract and confusing at times but remember, we have been using JavaScript this entire time. We are just taking a closer look at how JavaScript performs under the hood so we can better understand how our code interacts with its environment.

In day's one and two we will be picking apart JavaScript and learn how our code executes at a granular level. We will also be learning about the fascinating behavior of closures and how we can leverage them in our own code. Finally we will be comparing inheritance vs composition when we design our applications. 

The final day, we will be taking look at search algorithms and how recursion works in JavaScript. For the mini project, you will have the opportunity to practice a mock interview with your peers. This is to get you familiar with how the technical interview process works when applying for JavaScript developer job. All these topics are extremely common to come across during the technical interview but learning these topics can also greatly improve our code.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Global Execution Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

* [Functional Execution Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#Function_context)

* [Stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

* [Queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

* [Callback Queues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#Event_loop)

* [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Quicksort)

## Learning Objectives

* You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Explain the differences between a global execution context and a function execution context.

* Identify when a function execution context is created and what is stored in it.

* Describe the functions of the call stack and the callback queue.

* Compare and contrast a stack vs a queue in terms of LIFO and FIFO.

* Summarize asynchronous behavior and the role of the event loop.

* Construct their own higher order functions.

* Explain the lexical environment.

* Identify encapsulated variables.

* Create a factory function.

* Distinguish the difference between inheritance and composition design.

* Implement a linear search algorithm.

* Use recursion to solve a Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

* Implement a binary search algorithm and know when to use it over a linear search algorithm.

* Write shell scripts to be executed from the command line.

* Articulate and implement sorting algorithms in a technical interview setting.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

In the homework youâ€™ll create a technical tutorial explaining how a particular regular expression functions. A regular expression, or regex, is a search pattern used by developers. In the tutorial, youâ€™ll break down each part of the expression and describe what it does.

## Career Connection

Career Services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/{XX-TITLE}/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

## Heads-Up

Next unit we will be returning to databases, learning about `NoSQL`. We will have a chance to learn about how non-relational databases work and some of the difference it has compared to a SQL database. Finally, we will touch on why we might use `NoSQL` for our application.
