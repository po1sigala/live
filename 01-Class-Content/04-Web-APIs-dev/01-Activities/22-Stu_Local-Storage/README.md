 # 🏗️ Implement Client-Side Storage for Sign-Up Form Using localStorage

  Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

  * As a developer, I want to save the email and password to client-side storage and render the last submission to the page.

  ## Acceptance Criteria

  * It's done when `Last Registered User: ` displays the last email and password saved using `localStorage`, if it exists.

  * It's done when the `signUpButton` is clicked, the email and password entered into the text boxes is saved using `localStorage`.

  * It's done when the information under `Last Registered User: ` is updated to reflect the data stored using `localStorage`.

  ## 💡 Hints

  What methods do we use with `localStorage` to get and set items?

  ## 🏆 Bonus

  If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

  * Does data stored using `localStorage` have an expiration date? What happens when the browser is closed?

  Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
