# Speed Reader 

In this activity you are going to create a speed reading application. It will input a single word on the screen at a time, changing to the next word after 1 second. This equates to reading at 60 Words Per Minute (WPM).

## Instructions

* The app should countdown from 5, and when the countdown is finished it should print one word to the screen every second. Each word replaces the other.

* Open `index.html` and create the necessary HTML. You will need at least 3 elements.

* Open `script.js`.

  * The two function names have been created for you, as well as a poem to speed read.

* Fill out the necessary code that would create a countdown timer. When that timer completes, it should disappear and speed reading should begin.
