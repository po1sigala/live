## üí° Hints

How would you use parent-child relationships to access the elements you want to style? 

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Using `.getElementbyId()` is just one way to return an element. What are some other document methods that allow us to quickly access elements?
