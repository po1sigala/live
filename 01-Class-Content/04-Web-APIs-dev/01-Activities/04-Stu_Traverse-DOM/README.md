## üí° Hints

How might you use `.children` and `.childNode` to access the elements you want to style?  

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Using  `.getElementbyId` is just one way to return an element. How might you access an  element if you did not have an id?  

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
