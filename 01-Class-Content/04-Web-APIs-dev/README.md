# Unit 04: Web APIs

## Overview:

This week, you'll learn about application programming interfaces, or APIs, which allow web developers to create dynamic, interactive web applications. APIs can help add a wide range of functionality to your code and are an essential part of a developer's toolbox.

APIs are even built directly in the browser. When a web page is loaded in the browser an object representation of the web page called the Document Object Model or DOM is created. As a programming interface, the DOM allows us to use JavaScript to interact with HTML elements.

During class and in the homework, you will practice navigating the DOM and learn to create and manipulate HTML elements, add event listeners, create timers and store data -- all using the power of JavaScript and an API built in the browser itself.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Window Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window)

* [Document Object Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model)

* [Querying the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll) 

* [Element's Style Property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ElementCSSInlineStyle/style)

* [Setting Element's Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute)

* [Creating DOM Elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node/appendChild)

* [Intervals and Timers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval)

* [Event Listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener)

* [Keyboard Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent)

* [Preventing Default Browser Behavior](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/preventDefault)

* [Event Bubbling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/stopPropagation)

* [Local and Session Storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage)

* [Data Attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Identify the Document Object Model and its relationship to HTML.

* Select and dynamically generate HTML elements and content using Web API methods.

* Implement DOM API methods to handle events such as key presses and mouse clicks.

* Explain event propagation and implement handling functions.

* Store and retrieve data using the browser's local and session storage.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` video(s) for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

### Algorithms

  * [01-log-even-nums](./03-Algorithms/01-log-even-nums)

  * [02-countdown](./03-Algorithms/02-countdown)

  * [03-sum-array](./03-Algorithms/03-sum-array)

    * ðŸ“¹ Let's Code [Sum of Array](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/iz6bzizsnj)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

In this week's homework, you will build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This weekâ€™s coursework focuses on the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## Career Connection

Career Services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about Career Services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [Career Services website](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

When you are are researching DOM and event resources, you may come across jQuery solutions. JQuery is a great, lightweight JavaScript library that allows you execute JavaScript functionality with just a few lines of code. We will cover jQuery in the next unit, but for now stick to resources that do not rely on jQuery or the `$` variable.

## Resources

Here are some additional resources to help solidify the topics covered in this unit:
