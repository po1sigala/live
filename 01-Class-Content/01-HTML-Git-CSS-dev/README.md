# Unit 01: HTML, CSS and Git

## Overview:

At the heart of every website is HTML. **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage is the standard language used to define the structure of a web page. As developers, we use HTML to define the elements on a webpage including paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

CSS is used to add styling to the elements created with HTML. **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets determines how elements are presented on the page. This includes altering the font, color, size, the positioning of an element, or even adding animation. 

In this unit, you'll learn how to build web pages that use HTML and CSS to define the structure of a page and give it style. You will also be introduced to Git, a version control system that stores your code and its history and allows you to share your code with others. These skills form the building blocks for web development and are essential tools you will use throughout your career.

## Homework

Accessibility is an increasingly important consideration in web design. Inclusive design aims to make sure all users -- including those with disabilities -- are able to interact and understand a web page's content.

During this week's homework, you will take an existing website and use the HTML and CSS skills practiced during this week to make sure the site is accessible using the provided guidelines.
