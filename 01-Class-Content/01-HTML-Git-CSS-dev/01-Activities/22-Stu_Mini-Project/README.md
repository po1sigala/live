# Unit 01 Mini-Project: Landing Page

In this activity, you will work with a group to build a landing page using HTML and CSS.

## Instructions

The completed application should meet the following criteria:

* As a client, I want to view a single web page to collect visitor's contact information.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a header and footer.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have an image with a caption.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a contact form.

* As a client, I want the landing page to have a polished and accessible UI.

### Specifications

* Uses semantic HTML elements.

* Uses universal, element and class selectors in CSS.

* Uses at least three colors in design.

* Uses a single font and font family for all text on page.

* Uses at least two heading `<h1>...<h6>` tags.

* The header should be fixed to the top of the page on scroll.

* The header should contain a navigation bar with three links that display inline including a `contact` link.

* When the `contact` link is clicked, the page should jump directly to the contact form.

* The contact form should include `input` elements for name and email.

* The contact form should include `textarea` elements for message.

* The contact form should include a submit `button`.

* The image should include a descriptive `alt` attribute.

* The project should be deployed to GitHub Pages.

## üí° Notes

Follow these instructions to create your project and deploy it to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a new repository on your GitHub account and clone it to your computer.

2. When you're ready to deploy, use `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` commands to save and push your code to your GitHub repository.

3. Navigate in your browser to your GitHub repository and then navigate into your repository's `Settings` tab on the right side of the repository's page.

4. From the settings page, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section and then, in the section labeled `Source`, select that you would like to use the `main` branch as your source.

5. Navigate to `<your-github-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>` and you will find that your new web page has gone live! (For example, if your GitHub username is `lernantino` and the project is `css-demo-site`, your URL would be `lernantino.github.io/css-demo-site`)

You can also refer to this [YouTube video](https://youtu.be/P4Mu1t5rIXg) to walk through the steps needed to deploy.

**Important**: It may take a few moments for GitHub pages to display your site correctly. If your project doesn't deploy or show up, make sure that all file paths in your application are relative and using the right casing. GitHub is case-sensitive, so there is a difference between a capitalized and uncapitalized letter to them.
