# 📖 Create a New Github Repository

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to create a new Github repository and add an HTML file to it.  

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a new repository named `first-day-repo` using the GitHub user interface.

* It's done when I have cloned the `first-day-repo` to my local machine.

* It's done when I have used terminal commands to navigate into the `first-day-repo` directory.

* It's done when I have used terminal commands to create an `index.html` file.

* It's done when I add and commit my changes using git commands.

* It's done when I push the changes to the remote repository.
