# Lazy Loading Images

In this activity you are going to work with the Intersection Observer API to implement lazy loading functionality for our Gallery App.

## Instructions

* You will only be working within `loadImages.js`. Specifically `initLazyImages` function.

* Read through the [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Loading) provided below. Use the example code provided and adapt it to work with the `Gallery App`

* **Note**: You will need to make some changes to the code to get it working in your application.
