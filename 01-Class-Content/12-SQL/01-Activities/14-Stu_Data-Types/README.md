# 📖 Implement Data Types and Constraints 

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to add data types and constraints to my table.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when each column in the `customers` table has a defined data type and constraint.

* It's done when the values in the `id`, `first_name` and `last_name` columns cannot be `NULL`.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MySQL Docs on Data Types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html)

## 💡 Hints

If no value is supplied to a column, what value is set by default? 

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Why would we want to add constraints to our table?
