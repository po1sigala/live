# Unit 17: Computer Science For JavaScript

## Overview:

In this unit, we will look at how computer science relates to JavaScript in order to prepare you for the technical interview process that every developer will eventually face. Some of these topics may feel abstract and confusing at times, but remember&mdash;you have been using JavaScript for several months. Now we are just taking a closer look at how JavaScript executes so we can better understand how our code interacts with its environment.

In the first two lessons, we will dissect JavaScript in order to learn how our code executes at a granular level. We will also explore the fascinating behavior of closures and how we can leverage them in our own code. Finally, we will compare inheritance and composition in application design. 

In the final lesson, we will review search algorithms and how recursion works in JavaScript. Fro the mini-project, you will practice a mock interview with your peers. This will give you an opportunity to learn about the technical interview portion of the web-developer job interview process. You'll address topics that are foundational to improving code performance and commonly found in technical interviews.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* [Global Execution Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)

* [Functional Execution Context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#Function_context)

* [Stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

* [Queues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)

* [Callback Queues](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop#Event_loop)

* [Bubble Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Bubble_sort)

* [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Quicksort)

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to:

* Explain the differences between a global execution context and a function execution context.

* Identify when a function execution context is created and what is stored in it.

* Describe the functions of the call stack and the callback queue.

* Compare and contrast a stack vs. a queue in terms of LIFO and FIFO.

* Summarize asynchronous behavior and the role of the event loop.

* Construct a higher order functions.

* Explain the lexical environment.

* Identify encapsulated variables.

* Create a factory function.

* Distinguish between inheritance and composition design.

* Implement a linear search algorithm.

* Use recursion to solve a Fibonacci sequence algorithm.

* Implement a binary search algorithm and know when to use it over a linear search algorithm.

* Write shell scripts to be executed from the command line.

* Articulate and implement sorting algorithms in a technical interview setting.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the following `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` videos for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm:

* [01: Reverse Words](./03-Algorithms/01-reverse-no-built-in)

* [02: Left Rotation](./03-Algorithms/02-left-rotation)

    * ðŸ“¹ [Let's Code Left Rotation!](https://2u-20.wistia.com/medias/kfyhj4z6fn)

* [03: Reverse in Place](./03-Algorithms/03-reverse-in-place)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering technical interview questions and solving coding challenges.

## Homework

In the homework, youâ€™ll create a technical tutorial explaining how a particular regular expression functions. A regular expression, or regex, is a search pattern used by developers. In the tutorial, youâ€™ll break down each part of the expression and describe what it does.

## Career Connection

Career Services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](./04-Career-Connection/README.md). For more information about Career Services, including coding milestones, demo days, technical toolkits, workshops, and additional resources, visit the [Career Services website](http://bit.ly/CodingCS).

## Heads-Up

In the next unit, we will return to databases&mdash;in particular, NoSQL databases. We will learn about how non-relational databases work and compare them to SQL databases. Finally, we will touch on why we might use NoSQL for our application.

## Resources

This section contains some additional resources to help solidify the topics covered in this unit.
