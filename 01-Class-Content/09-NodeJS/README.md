# Unit 09: Node.js and ES6+

## Overview

Youâ€™ve arrived at another important milestone in your journey. The JavaScript you wrote for your first project was executed entirely on the client side, though it used third-party server-side APIs. In this and later units, youâ€™ll learn how to write your own server-side applications to handle requests and ultimately to build your own APIs.

In a previous era, this would be the point when youâ€™d begin learning a second programming language, like PHP, to write server-side code. Luckily, Node.js&mdash;released in 2009&mdash;makes this unnecessary. Node.js is an implementation of the V8 JavaScript engine without Chrome. It allows you to write server-side code using JavaScript. This means that you no longer need a browser to run JavaScript. You can (and will) do so from the command line!

In this unit, youâ€™ll learn how to initialize a Node.js project, install third-party dependencies, and create interactive command-line applications. Node.js ships with a **standard library**. The standard library contains a number of modules that allow you to extend the functionality of Node.js, like `fs`, which youâ€™ll use to read and write files. Youâ€™ll also learn how to add a large and robust ecosystem of third-party modules to applications to extend their functionality.

## Key Topics

The following topics will be covered in this unit:

* Node.js

    * `process.argv`

    * `fs`

* Modularization

    * `require()`

    * `module.exports`

* npm

    * `package.json`

    * `npm init`

    * `node_modules`

* `inquirer`

* ES6

    * `let` and `const`

    * Arrow functions

    * Template literals

    * Array methods (`map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`)

    * Spread and rest

    * Destructuring arrays and objects

* Asynchronous JavaScript

    * Callbacks

    * Promises

    * Async/await

    * Fetch API

    * Axios

## Learning Objectives

You will be employer-ready if you are able to: 

* Build interactive command-line applications that process user input.

* Explain modularization and how it relates to npm and the standard library.

* Initialize new Node.js projects with npm, and install and import dependencies.

* Explain the importance and usefulness of ES6+ concepts such as `let`, `const`, and arrow functions.

* Handle asynchrony with callbacks, Promises, and async/await.

* Make server-side API calls with the Fetch API and Axios.

## Technical Interview Preparation

You will be employer-competitive if you are able to solve the following algorithms and successfully complete the assessments.

### Algorithms

Practicing algorithm-based interview questions is one of the best ways to prepare for interviews. Watch the `ðŸ“¹ Let's Code` videos for tips and tricks on how to solve the algorithm.

* [01: Character Count](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/03-Algorithms/01-character-count)

* [02: Product of Largest Two](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/03-Algorithms/02-product-of-largest-two)

* [03: Camel Case](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/03-Algorithms/03-camel-case)

### Assessments

Assess your knowledge by answering the following technical interview questions:

* What is npm?

* What are three of the major changes introduced to JavaScript in ES6?

* What are three approaches to handling asynchronous JavaScript?

## Homework

In the homework for this unit, youâ€™ll create a command-line application that uses input from a user to dynamically generate a quality readme for a GitHub project.

## Career Connection

Career Services material for this unit is located in the [Career Connection folder](../../../01-Class-Content/09-NodeJS/04-Career-Connection/README.md).

## Heads-Up

In this unit, you'll begin to use Node.js. Be sure to have it installed on your computer _before_ attending your classes. You can follow the installation instructions for Mac and Windows on the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
