# 🏗️ Implement and Recognize Object Destructuring

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know how to use destructuring assignment syntax to pluck out data from arrays or objects

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have opened `index.js` and reviewed the existing code.

* It's done when I use destructuring assignment so that each `console.log` statement logs out the value properly.

## 💡 Hints

We have likely seen destructuring more than we think in our everyday lives as developers. Is there an import statement that you can remember in a previous exercise that uses this syntax?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

Write an object of your own and then log each key value pair using object destructuring.

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
