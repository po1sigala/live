# inquirer Users

In this activity, you will build a simple command-line application that accepts user input and writes it to a `.json` file. 

## Instructions

* Initialize your repository and install the `inquirer` dependency.

    * Is there another dependency you will need? 

* Prompt your user with the following questions:

    * "What is your name?"

    * “What languages do you know?”

    * “What is your preferred method of communication?”

* Then write the user response to a file. 

## Hints

* You will need to use `JSON.stringify()`.

* You will need to consult the `inquirer` documentation on how to prompt users for checkboxes and lists.

## Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How would you format your JSON? Can you generate the name of your user file from the user input?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com/) or another search engine to research this.
