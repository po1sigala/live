# Convert Const Let Arrow

In this activity, we will convert a prebuilt Crystal Guessing Game to use the new ES6 syntax we are learning about.

## Instructions

* Open [Unsolved/index.html](Unsolved/index.html) in your web browser and take a moment to understand the application's functionality.

  * This example is similar to the Crystal Guessing Game we worked on many weeks ago.

* Now open [Unsolved/index.js](Unsolved/index.js) in your code editor and convert the existing code over to use the ES6 syntax we've learned about in the previous examples.

* Make sure to do the following:

1. Convert all `var` identifiers to use `const` or `let`; whichever is more appropriate.

2. Convert functions to arrow functions _where suitable_; remember, arrow functions are not right for every situation.
