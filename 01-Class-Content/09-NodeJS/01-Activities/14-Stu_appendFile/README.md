# appendFile

In this activity, you will create a commit logger that records commit messages (for poetic purposes) using `fs`.

## Instructions

* In your working directory, create a Node.js application, `index.js`, that accepts a command-line argument and, each time it is run, will write the argument to file _without_ overwriting the existing text.

## Notes

Refer to the documentation:
* [Node.js documentation on `fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html)

## Hints

* If `fs.readFile` reads a file and `fs.writeFile` writes&emdash;but _overwrites_&mdash;a file, what method do you think will allow you to _append_ text to a file?

## Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How would you add arguments on new lines? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com/) or another search engine to research this.
