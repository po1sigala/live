# Arrow Function Practice

In this activity, we will convert a file with prewritten code over to use arrow functions where suitable.

## Instructions

1. Open [Unsolved/index.js](Unsolved/index.js) in your editor and run the code. Take a few minutes to study the values logged to the console, but don't worry about understanding every part of the code. For this activity you only need to remember the rules established about when arrow functions should and shouldn't be used.

2. Update this example to use arrow functions _where suitable_. If successful, the code should still work the exact same way.

## Hints

* Remember the case from the last example in which we should not be using arrow functions.

## Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* After you've converted all of the functions to arrow functions where possible, look for opportunities to shorten the arrow function syntax even further by removing parentheses and curly braces where allowed.
