# 🏗️ Implement and Use Spread and Rest Operators

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to use the spread and rest operators to make my code easier to read.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have copied the `songs` array using spread `...`

* It's done when I have console logged the new array.

* It's done wheen I have modified the `addition` function so that it retains functionality but also allows one to pass in any number of arguments.

## 💡 Hints

* Can you think of some real life analogies for the spread and rest operator?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other data types can we use the spread or rest operator on?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

## Spread and Rest

**Follow the comments in `index.js`.

1. Copy the `songs` array into another array using spread and console.log what it returns.

2.  Modify the `addition` function so that it uses the rest operator and maintains the same functionality. You should still be able to pass in any number of arguments. Run the code first in your console to see the functionality.
