# Instructions

* You have been tasked with creating a CLI Tool that generates an HTML Portfolio page.

  * Your application will ask the user for information, and output that information into an HTML document.

* You will need two files for this:

  * `index.js`
  * `package.json`

* When creating programs we always want to get an MVP (minimum viable product).

  * Our MVP for this project is just an HTML page displaying the users provides responses with no styling whatsoever.

* When you complete the MVP, you can begin to style the page that is generated.

* **Hints**:

* To create your HTML it would be easiest to use a dummy `index.html` document. This will allow you to have HTML syntax highlighting making it easier to write your HTML.
