# Instructions

* In this activity you are going to check if a mock function has been called

* You will write your function within `Mocks.js` and your tests within `Mocks.test.js`.

* Create a function which takes in 2 numbers and a callback

* Add those two numbers, then pass that value into a call to your callback function

* Write a test that expects the mock function to be called once.

* This is complete when the test for one mock call is passing.
