# Instructions

* For this activity you will create 2 functions.

* You will write your functions in `MultipleTest.js` and your tests will be written in `MultipleTest.test.js`.

  * The first functions will compare two values which will equate to `true` or `false`

    * Use the `toBeFalsy()` matcher

  * The second functions will take in 3 arguments. It will then add the first two together and then divide the sum by the 3rd.

    * Use the `toBeGreaterThan()` matcher

* You will write tests for both functions in a separate file. (You should have two files when complete).

* You have completed this activity when both your tests are passing when running `npm run test`.
