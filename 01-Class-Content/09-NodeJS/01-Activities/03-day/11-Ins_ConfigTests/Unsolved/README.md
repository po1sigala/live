# Instructions

* Create a package.json via npm.

* First write a function that passes the test case provided for you in `HelloWorld.test.js`.

  * **Note**: The test is incomplete and will need you to fill in 2 parts.

* Next, configure your project to have jest use the `notifyMode` configuration to send a notification when tests pass.

* **Hint**: Utilize the [Jest Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration) to find the `notifyMode` and other parameters.
