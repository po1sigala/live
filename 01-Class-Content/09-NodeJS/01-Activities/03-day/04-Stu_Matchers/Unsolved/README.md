# Instructions

* In this activity we are going to use a new `matcher` to check the value of a function

* You will write your function in `Matchers.js` and your functions will be written in `Matchers.test.js`.

* Create a function that adds two `floating point` numbers. i.e., `0.7, 1.1, 2.3`.

* Then write a test that checks if the sum of these two values is around the proper expected output

* Use [Jest's Matcher Docs](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/using-matchers) to find the correct matcher for this case.
