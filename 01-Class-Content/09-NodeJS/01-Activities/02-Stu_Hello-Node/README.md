# Hello Node.js

In this activity, you will write and run your first Node.js application.

## Instructions

1. Create a file, `index.js`, in your working directory.

2. Write JavaScript to log the string "Hellooo, Node!"

3. Then run the program using Node.js from the command line.

4. Confirm that it logged the text as you would expect.

## Hints

* It's just JavaScript.

## Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What happens when you log `window`? What happens when you try to use `prompt`, `alert`, or `confirm`?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com/) or another search engine to research this, or try it yourself.
