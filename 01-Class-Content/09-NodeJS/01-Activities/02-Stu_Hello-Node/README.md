# 🏗️ Create Node.js Application

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to be able to write programs for use with Node.

* As a developer, I want to make a program that accepts a string as an input and logs it to the terminal. 

## Acceptance Criteria

@TODO WRITE ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR THE USER STORY; e.g.:

* It's done when I have created a file, `index.js`, in my working directory.
  
* It's done when I have written JavaScript to log the string "Hellooo, Node!"

* It's done when I have ran the program from the command line using `node index`.

* It's done when I have confirmed the expected output.

## 💡 Hints

Is there a difference in the way we code for the browser's developer console?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What happens when you log `window`? What happens when you try to use `prompt`, `alert`, or `confirm`?
