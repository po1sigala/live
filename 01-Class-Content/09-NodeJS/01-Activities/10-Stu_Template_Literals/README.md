# 🏗️ Implement Template Literals

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to know how to use template strings render HTML.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I have created a `music` object in `Unsolved/index.js`.

* It's done when I have added title, artist, and album properties to the `music` object.

* It's done when I have used template strings in the `div` tags to output data from the music object.

* It's done when I open `index.html` and see the results.

## 💡 Hints

* Can we use template strings in place of string concatenation?

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* The dollar sign is used a lot in javascript and it's easy to get confused with what syntax belongs to what piece of technology. What are some other places you have seen the dollar sign used?
